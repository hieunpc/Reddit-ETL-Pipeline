E.g they wanted to mix detailed data with aggregated snapshots in one table. I did not wantnto argue. I said ""well Kimball advises against this because its trouble"" and let them build it. After some time they split the fact tables into transaction and aggregate.It is not Kimball's ideas in the book, but experience of a wide industry practicioners over years of working with data.

Since people are going to suspect LLMs anyway, I used one to try to reorganize it.I would probably add some testing too.---# Data Engineering Pipeline Checklist## 1. Requirements First- **SLA**: How fresh? (minutes/hours/daily) Daily reporting → no streaming needed- **Impact**: Cost of being late/wrong?- **Consumer**: Dashboards, ML, reporting?## 2. Architecture**Single source of truth**: One storage layer (warehouse/lakehouse/object storage). Everything reads from it.**Batch over streaming**: Streaming adds complexity (ordering, retries, idempotency, late events, backfills). Default to batch unless real-time is essential.**Design for backfills**: Parameterized date ranges, versioned transforms, separate raw/modeled layers.## 3. Reliability**Idempotency**: Jobs must be safely rerunnable via partitioned outputs, overwrite-by-partition/merge strategies, deterministic keys.**Orchestration**: Use Airflow/Dagster/Prefect for retries, dependencies, visibility, parameterized runs. Avoid ""cron spaghetti.""## 4. Observability**Minimum to prevent silent failures**:- Row counts/volume checks- Freshness checks- Schema drift alerts- Job duration tracking## 5. Performance**Optimize last**. Most slowness comes from bad joins, file layout, or moving too much data—not lack of Spark.**Fix basics first**: Partitioning, columnar formats, filter pushdown, avoid cartesian joins.## 6. Simplicity Rule**If your SLA is met with**: scheduler + Python/SQL + storage + basic checks**Then distributed systems add unnecessary complexity.****Use distributed systems when**:- Volume exceeds single-machine capacity (hundreds GB–TBs)- True real-time requirements (sub-minute)- Complex streaming aggregations- Multiple concurrent consumers need isolation",sib_n,2025-12-19 01:49:33,10,dataengineering,t3_1ppuky6,False,

Business folks need someone to make sense of the data chaos, and it’s pretty satisfying to be the one who stitches it together into something useful.I’ve been director-level for about 15 years and managed to stay pretty hands-on until recently. Even now, I try to keep up so I can actually lead effectively, and I’ll jump at any excuse to write some code just to stay sharp (and maybe flex a bit for the team!).If you’re losing passion, I’d seriously look at changing projects or orgs before bailing on the field. A good team and leadership that encourage experimentation and improvement make a huge difference.

We have a diverse set of products that rather naturally lends itself to this approach, and have aquired a centralized dataplattform (databricks) to gather all of our data. What ends up happening is that all the system developers refuse to migrate to a new workflow and keeps on with their own little DB silos without sending data to the lakehosue, and the same people that used to work on the datawarehouse now have to become virtual members in the product teams to shuffle the data to the lakehouse in much the same way that they used to before. Only now they have to adhere to the product owners whims as to how they do things in the product, and how the product owner wants them to do ingestion etc. Of course this all happens in IT, and the business users who hold all of the business knowledge (how the data is used) are still outside of IT, and the datawarehouse people who could previously work with them directly are now no longer allowed to do so and have to prepare data that is WAY worse to work with for the analysts than what they had in the datawarehouse.",TaylorExpandMyAss,2025-12-14 15:01:22,40,dataengineering,t3_1pme0ww,False,

ntzq01x,"We have a central DE team and a central BI team. We haven't implemented a data mesh, though we have talked about it. A lot of the teams organically adopted systems and contractors and do own their own data. But they aren't generally technical users and there was no governance or standards. And all the data became siloed. The central DE team is working to unsilo the data. Our goal is to eventually create data standards and enforce them so the data is actually a good quality. This is a slow process, but I'm optimistic. The central BI team does seem to have a problem with scale. At my company, most of the functional users don't have BI experts and can't use PBI - at least nowhere near the quality that the BI team does. However, the BI team moves quite slowly to produce the reporting. The result is that functional teams build their own custom, low governance, reporting off the centralized data out of necessity. By the time BI develops the right tools, the business doesn't need it anymore and doesn't want to switch. My untested idea is to give the business access to easy to use cloud based dashboarding tools (like Sigma for example). Then BI provides support, underlying data models, and connectivity to non enterprise grade sources like SharePoint. In short, decentralizing everything without governance cannot work. Centralizing everything without a plan to scale cannot work. A data mesh is the tightrope that attempts to balance this.

ntzpk4a,"I think the general consensus is that data mesh was a failure. Some will point out that most people just failed to implement it correctly. As usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. An architecture is only as good as its adoption. There are plenty of tools, processing patterns, architectures, etc that are excellent if you have the ability, resources, and will to implement them. In reality, the vast majority of companies do not. The key is to not throw out the baby with the bath water. For every “failed” implementation of Mesh, Agile, Hadoop, etc we’ve had through the years there has been incremental progress, evidenced by the plethora of options we have today to build data engineering stacks and teams to fit the different needs of companies. For me, data mesh was indicative of a paradigm shift from the old school prescriptive warehouse to a modern democratization enabled and fueled by the cycle of real-world problem solving. Data warehouse, data mart, self serve bi, data lake, data mesh, lakehouse. It’s just an evolution of trying to solve the same(ish) problem.

So we had a ton of technical debt that accrued during our mvp/pilot because these teams where building toward a centralized architecture with NO data domains and not engaging with any of the missions.We used AWS native services and data bricks because a few of the missions already had architectures.We are 18 months in and the benefits are close but far at the same time.

nu7ux2k,"I worked at a Fortune 100 as a data leader pursuing several of the key principles defined in Data Mesh. We didn’t say we were implementing Data Mesh because few outside IT knew about it or understood it. Instead, our aim was to modernize the data platform, speed up delivery of technical solutions, and empower the business with self-service capabilities and less reliance on the IT organization.We were successful in many areas while other elements remained a challenge. For example, we migrated the two largest data platforms from on-premises, self-hosted and managed servers, to native services in the public cloud. Later, we built “lakehouse” capabilities on top of the public cloud platform. These included data governance features, automated data security, and data domains built for key areas of the business such as human resources, marketing, supply chain, etc. The benefits were quite profound. Within the first 2 years we had empowered 50+ business teams. Between year 1 and year 2 we saw 500% growth in teams able to use their data and the platform to create things that matter. Business teams recognized improved decision-making across the enterprise, increased efficiency and cost savings, accelerated speed-to-value for data product creation, and secure data sharing between teams.While we experienced success, the challenges were many. Some teams thought the changes were just another fad IT came up with. Given their prior experiences they were honestly justified in thinking that. Other teams were interested but couldn’t get their leadership to buy in or they didn’t have enough technical chops to harness their domain data on their own. They continued to rely on central IT. Other business teams were so focused on their own projects and demands they simply couldn’t make the initial shift. They asked us to come back later. A thru line that helped in most situations was having clear executive leadership support (CIO, CEO, CDO, and others). They would knock down roadblocks where needed and help provide resources when we got stuck.After 3 years in the journey one thing was abundantly clear. Technology was not the largest challenge. People and culture were. It took tremendous energy to cast the vision and bring people and teams along with us. This required persistent communication with all business teams and clear demonstration of the value of public cloud through demos, pilots, and “soft releases” of products, apps, and services. The technical teams (platforms, cloud, data, security) all became storytellers if they weren’t already. To this day I don’t call the transformation a “data mesh implementation.” But we certainly knew of and studied Data Mesh and sought to implement core principles it espoused: self-service, decentralized data domains/ownership, data governance, and a focus on data product creation within business teams.",trajik210,2025-12-15 20:37:52,2,dataengineering,t3_1pme0ww,False,

You may attempt to alleviate this somewhat by providing good metadata for context, but my experience is that this doesn't really solve the problem and i very much doubt this will improve untill we get a different class of models all together as the ""more data+larger models"" approach yields diminishing returns due to sublinear scaling of LLMs wrt. data and size.Note: you should take everything i say with a grain of salt, as i am a practitioner using LLMs and my formal training is in physics, not NLP.",TaylorExpandMyAss,2025-12-14 13:14:53,14,dataengineering,t3_1pmda5y,False,

ntt184i,I don't think a different branching strategy would help much in your case. I would advise to re-evaluate your architecture with these common coding conflicts in mind trying to have a better way of developing together without swimming in eachothers water.The only part is when bugfixes are pushed that your developers should also merge this into their branches.In my environment (25 developers) we had a similar issue and the solution was to split our codebase in smaller chunks but also build stronger unittests which have to succeed before the pull request can be merged.

That, plus getting them comfortable with the idea of merging down from main into their feature before attempting to push back up into main will all go a long way towards not only getting rid of conflicts but also driving consistency and quality of code in general.

My team can get a change implemented, tested, reviewed and pushed to prod in 30m or less if we wanted to. The key is to give the peers a heads up that you have a change that needs to be fast tracked before you start development so everybody in the chain of responsibilities are aware and ready to engage when development is complete.The challenge you describe with merge conflicts should only happen if multiple people are working on the exact same file. If this is a common occurrence, you should understand why multiple people need to change the same file. Your code structure may need to be improved to separate a monolithic file into smaller individual files and rebuilt in runtime.Additionally, having good branch hygiene is important. Don't keep reusing the same branch for all changes. Open a new branch for each change and prune orphaned branches. Every new change should be based on the current state of Prod so the resulting PR should only be the specific change you are trying to make. Once the PR is merged, you should delete the branch. If a new change is needed, create a new branch.

Note that through the majority of the history of data warehouses the principal platforms were general purpose databases like db2, oracle and sql server. In fact there's very few features in say snowflake that you can't find in the general purpose databases.A few considerations: * It all depends on your total data volume, the data volume your queries will be scanning, the number of queries, etc, etc, etc. * But a 10-20 TB data warehouse using Postgres can work absolutely fine. * Partitioning is critical * Summary/aggregate tables may be critical if you want really fast queries for dashboards, etc. I like to monitor my use of these like one would monitor buffer space / caches for transactional databases - and try to get 95+% of my queries to hit them. * Certain queries will benefit from the use of indexes. This can provide a significant edge to performance. * Configuring your database to support query parallelism is also critical at volume. * Database constraints are just as important in OLAP as they are in OLTP - and postgres can provide a ton of value here! You may need to turn them off on massive fact tables, but you can also use them at least with summary & dimension tables. * AWS RDS has pretty slow IO, but other hosting options can provide blisteringly-fast servers. But you may need to have postgres dba skills. * All the above assumes vanilla postgres. Adding extensions for duckdb, columnar storage (hydra), etc can provide faster performance in many cases.FYI: I migrated part of my snowflake reporting to postgres on RDS a few years ago in order to save a bunch of money.

They have other, more pressing priorities and the benefit doesn't outweigh the cost of hiring a team of contractors to do it.""But let's say you think there's a big pool of potential adopters for whom SQLMesh II would make business sense. It's not so easy to take a slightly superior technology and turn that into a going concern. dbt has mass adoption.Are you personally planning to fork SQLMesh and spend a substantial chunk of your time maintaining it, if Fivetran strip the original for parts? Perhaps you will fund this via a hosted version - will you be picking up the phone to pitch it to companies yourself, or will you use your own money to pay someone to do that?What will you do if Fivetran freak out as soon as you get traction and throw a bunch of engineers at making dbt good enough to kill your competitive advantage? Unlike SQLMesh-original-flavour, you don't have proprietary code; Fivetran have access to the same stuff plus a lot more resources.Remember, you _only_ get acquired if it makes business sense to them to spend the money on buying you out ... instead of on using their own engineering team to outcompete you.

The article explains these well. Key concept here is loading only what you need to, making it useful in situations where the amount of data is very large and/or compute is a concern.A key thing to understand would be is\_icremental(), which is a function which will return True if the model it is being applied in *already exists* in the warehouse (and is also an incremental model which is not running in full-refresh)That means anything wrapped within is\_incremental() won’t be applied the first time you run a model, or when you fully refresh it.This is what you use to compare existing records in your target with your source so you only load the new and/or updated records, depending on your strategy.You can also flip that and use NOT is\_incremental(), meaning that what you wrap it around will only run the first time the model is built (or on full refreshes). That could for example be if you have some old stale data that you need to union with on the first run, but then never need to look at again, except for the case of a full refresh.EDIT: For some clarity, heres an example of an incremental model from dbt docs.If this model has never been run before, or needs to be fully refreshed (reloaded) then `{% if is_incremental() %}` will evaluate to false, meaning that the SQL it wraps wont be sent to the warehouse. That makes sense, since `{{ this }}` will be rendered as the incremental models name. Hard to do a select from something that doesnt exist yet right? We need to compare event\_time in source with what we have loaded before, which we cant do if we've never loaded it.Once we've loaded data for the first time, the if statement will evaluate to true, meaning the WHERE clause gets put into effect. Then the models SQL will return results using that filtering, and that's what ends up getting inserted into the target table in your DWH. {{ config( materialized='incremental' ) }} select *, my_slow_function(my_column) from {{ ref('app_data_events') }} {% if is_incremental() %} -- this filter will only be applied on an incremental run -- (uses >= to include records whose timestamp occurred since the last run of this model) -- (If event_time is NULL or the table is truncated, the condition will always be true and load all records) where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from {{ this }} ) {% endif %}",vickelajnen,2025-12-15 06:32:11,5,dataengineering,t3_1pmwjju,False,

nu67tkw,"There’s actually a few things to be concerned with. One issue is making sure you are dealing with the proper timestamp. A lot of the examples in this space gloss over this aspect. For high water mark incremental processing you want to drive off of the timestamp representing the moment the record was written in your data warehouse/lakehouse/dbt. You do not want to rely on the application timestamp or the timestamp generated by your source system for incremental processing. For the purposes of this conversation, let’s assume `table_a` and `table_b` both represent this in a column named `dbt_updated_ts`.Another concern is persisting these timestamps in your target model. You will need to decide on `table_a.dbt_updated_ts` as `table_a_dbt_updated_ts` and `table_b.dbt_updated_ts` as `table_b_dbt_updated_ts` or doing something like `least(table_a.dbt_updated_ts, table_b.dbt_updated_ts) as source_dbt_updated_ts`. Regardless of the decision, you should *also* re-state a `dbt_updated_ts` for downstream consumers of your model. They should *not* look at your various source timestamps for incremental processing, only your new `dbt_updated_ts`And this is where the rub comes in. Now you have 2 sources with 2 different timestamps and you need to process them incrementally. A comprehensive way of doing this would be to take all the keys above the high water mark in source a and union with the keys above the high water mark in source b, union the keys together, then use that to scan both tables again to make sure you catch all the changes. Generally this is computationally expensive, although it should give the correct answer.If you are doing this to create something like a SCD type-2 dimension it gets more complicated on top of this, as you will now need to deal with the temporal aspects of your source system as well.I would warn you of this: if someone says add a lookback window, that is usually to cover some architectural sin. This should be questioned.It’s complicated and often computationally expensive to process multiple upstreams in an incremental fashion. Do not forget the maintenance cost: next month you will have an engineer who thinks they are clever and will mess with this logic and it may be ok for most cases but not certain edge cases. KISS. If you can, just materialize any model with multiple upstreams as `table` and save yourself the headache. Again, single-model HWM incremental is perfectly fine, it’s when you attempt to incremental more than one model at once where you will find pain.",raginjason,2025-12-15 15:50:18,6,dataengineering,t1_nu62qv9,False,
nu5lr9u,"You'll want to establish a single \`event\_time\` field (like the person mentioned that responded to you above) that you can use to check if a row needs to be updated by your incremental model.So if you're unioning multiple tables: SELECT id, action_date AS event_time FROM table_a UNION ALL SELECT id, event_at AS event_time FROM table_b UNION ALL SELECT id, timestamp AS event_time FROM table_cand then use `event_time` as your condition in your WHERE clause",creamycolslaw,2025-12-15 13:52:49,3,dataengineering,t1_nu5e134,False,
nu5hnle,"Depends on what you mean.If you're joining/unioning/selecting from other up stream incremental models, you don't really need to think about how they are materialized. At least I can't think of a scenario where you would need to consider that. I could also be completely wrong here, not something I've really given any thought.If you mean in the context of joins/unions within the same model, you still only really have to think about where and when you apply the is\_incremental() macro. To use the above example again (but expanded a bit), say we have some old stale data that we need to load, e.g. from some old source system, and then we're adding data from the new system on top. We still keep the same fields and everything.In this example, the first time we run the model, the first incremental macro will return false, because the model deosnt exist in our target dwh yet. The second macro will return true, since the target table doesnt exist yet. So then we will run the main query, and then union in the old data.On every subsequent run, the first macro will return true, and the second one false. So on all future runs, we will be filtering data from the new system, and disregarding the old one entirely, since no new data is being generated there.So we wrap SQL we want to compile and send to the warehouse depending on the context in which the model is running. In practice I've only used this to wrap a WHERE (most common), CTE's or UNIONs. You can also include multiple wrapped statements as below, for example we might apply an incremental macro inside our CTE's in order to make the model more performant. I find it hard to imagine a scenario where you would wrap it around a join. {{     config(         materialized='incremental'     ) }} select     customer_id,     period,     total_sales from {{ ref('app_data_events_from_new_system') }} {% if is_incremental() %}     where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from {{ this }} ) {% endif %} {% if not is_incremental() %}     union     select         customer_id,         period,         total_sales     from  {{ ref('app_data_events_from_old_system') }} {% endif %}This means that the compiled SQL will look like one of these 2 (excluding all of the DML that dbt builds in order to actually insert the data into the target table): -- FIRST RUN RESULTS IN select     customer_id,     period,     total_sales from new_db.new_schema.app_data_events_from_new_system     union     select         customer_id,         period,         total_sales     from  old_db.old_schema.app_data_events_from_old_system -- SUBSEQUENT RUNS RESULT IN select     customer_id,     period,     total_sales from new_db.new_schema.app_data_events_from_new_system where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from target_db.target_schema.target_table_with_app_data_from_both_source_systems)",vickelajnen,2025-12-15 13:28:30,1,dataengineering,t1_nu5e134,False,
nug07et,"Last paragraph imo is the big one. I have hardly met any coworkers that understand the problems that come with incrementals involving multiple tables. This means all of the incrementals they've built involving multiple tables are impossible to reproduce from scratch because those incremental tables are not being updated correctly. Had an entire database in a previous company where they would have to regularly refresh all of the datasets because of this and it would sometimes crash in the process. Absolute mess.For me, because I have the skillsets to do so, I pretty much prefer to stay away from any sort of incremental involving multiple tables and use table materializations like you mention unless I 1) really need it and 2) can implement it in a more generic way rather than a custom incremental model. More generic being something like a custom materialization or macro. For example, we have an incremental materialization that checks counts of the source query vs the incremental table by the incremental timestamp to load deltas. This makes the actual SQL in the DBT model involve no incremental logic and makes the DBT model robust to source data that sometimes updates some historical data instead of only inserting new data. If this scenario had been implemented as a basic DBT append-only incremental model (which it was before it got refactored), then the data would not match reporting from the source system.The example I gave speaks to another problem that goes beyond what you bring up (engineer that thinks they're being smart). There's also the problem that often times engineers will develop something with some assumption for how it's going to work in their mind. ""Oh, well we should only get new data for this process every day."" This is only sometimes true. I've worked at multiple companies and every company has had at least a couple of processes you might expect to work that way but don't for business or engineering reasons. For example, if you have a DBT model that involves updates from multiple tables, what happens if table A is updated later than table B? Then on the next run, you may have to update your incremental on late-arriving data from table A + historical data from table B, which leads to historical updates in your table. Of course, there's other ways to implement these things, but by no means trivial in my experience.",simplybeautifulart,2025-12-17 02:28:31,2,dataengineering,t1_nu67tkw,False,

If your team doesn’t have the support of a real decision maker you’ll run into huge problems getting the actual data.

nuba45t,"This ended up being longer than I expected. Hopefully you find this useful. There's actually a lot to your question.When it comes to designing a mart, I keep the ""analyst"" persona in mind as much as possible. This is my north star, even if I don't have analysts. Querying a star should be simple, not something full of odd case logic, analytic queries, coalesces, and the deep SQL knowledge. Save that for your transformations leading up to the star if needed.Regarding keys specifically, there are several goals I have when designing a mart. From the perspective of the ""analyst"" persona querynig the star:1. Joins (dims to facts) should be done with `INNER JOIN` not `OUTER JOIN` - this is for performance and for usability2. No records should be dropped via join - this is a quality issue, you should not be dropping revenue on the floor because your users dimension is incomplete or late for example3. Join conditions should be singular (e.g. no `AND` in join clause) in nature - this is again for performance and usabilityThe ideal query would look something like this: SELECT SUM(f.revenue) AS revenue, d.customer_name FROM fct_sales AS f INNER JOIN dim_customer AS d ON f.customer_sk = d.customer_sk GROUP BY d.customer_nameThese goals need to be addressed in concert. To do so, you really need a lookup process instead of a hashing strategy.In order to address 1 and 2, you really need to have placeholder records in your dimension for ""unknown"", ""missing"" or ""not applicable"" customers, and your fact table creation needs to use these values as appropriate. You cannot hash your way out of this problem; you need to process your dimension (or at least your dimension lookup) first, and then process your facts. Generally this is done with a lookup table. For item 3 in isolation of 1 and 2, if your dimension is SCD type-1 from a single system then using the source system natural key seems reasonable. Once you have multiple source systems (say, customers from 2 systems) then the natural progression is to either add a `source_system` column and make sure everyone remembers to join on that as well (hint: they won't) or to concatenate your source system with the natural key. This concatenation leaves you with a string key instead of an integer key which now negatively impacts query performance.If your dimension is SCD type-2, it's worse. You are left with something looking like this, which is not obvious to analysts, performs poorly, and is error prone: SELECT SUM(f.revenue) AS revenue, d.customer_name FROM fct_sales AS f INNER JOIN dim_customer AS d ON f.customer_nk = d.customer_nk AND f.transaction_ts BETWEEN d.begin_effective_ts AND d.end_effective_ts GROUP BY d.customer_name Usability note: Is it `BETWEEN` or did you do the right thing and make your `end_effective_ts` the same moment as the next `begin_effective_ts`? I can almost guarantee your analysts will either use `BETWEEN` or worse they won't consider the effective dates at all and `DISTINCT` the result set to get what they want. Honestly, it's doubtful that future engineers will remember which way you went with effective dates either. All the more reason to address this in your transformation while building the mart instead of leaving it to the mart consumers to remember.To achieve goal 3 with SCD type-2, you want to put a SK on the fact that represents the state of the dimension at a point in time (probably the moment of transaction). To do this you will also need a lookup, as you cannot hash your way out of this either.At this point it should be clear that lookups are the way to go. So the real question is why would you want a hash instead of an integer? To me, the answer is now obvious: integers take next to zero compute to calculate, will join more efficiently, have half a chance at clustering in a meaningful way, and are immune to collision.TL;DR integer lookups",raginjason,2025-12-16 10:42:58,2,dataengineering,t3_1pnjmno,False,

If ypou work with Python, there are two simple command line tools for validation that are part of the ""json-structure"" package: # Validate a schema file json-structure-check schema.json # Validate an instance against a schema json-structure-validate instance.json schema.jsonFrom a lifecycle perspective, you use schemas either where you produce data to ensure that it conforms to a set of rules AND/OR at the consumer end to ensure that it conforms to a set of rules. In code and databases, that structure manifests in column declarations or typed fields, and having a neutral data definition language that comes with ""polyglot"" tooling and know many languages and database table schema dialects is therefore helpful for data structures and data to not get lost in translation.I have very successfully used the specs as instruction files with LLMs (e.g. Copilot) so when you want to infer a schema from existing data structures with the spec in the context, you often get very good results, and from there you are on a type safe path.

IMO it’s an extremely hard problem to solve if you want to get beyond basic questions like how much did client x spend in q4 or whatever.I think the approach you are describing is probably as isolated and secure as you could possibly need to get, and may not be flexible enough to provide real business value. But it depends on what sort of questions you want the agent to answer. If you want agents to do things actual human analysts are currently doing, I think allowing the ai to explore the schema and basically do multi turn “deep research” with access to a large portion of the warehouse plus a semantic layer explaining tables and data relationships is probably going to be needed. My current opinion is that if I was going to something as isolated and controlled as what you are describing I might as well just build a dashboard with those curated views available.",Advanced-Average-514,2025-12-17 13:37:24,2,dataengineering,t3_1pos8n2,False,

nuiqn48,"u/Advanced-Average-514 \- Totally fair take and I agree with the core tradeoff you’re pointing at.A couple clarifications on our intent though:1. We’re not trying to recreate a human analyst doing open-ended exploration (yet). We’re aiming for safe, repeatable workflows first.. the stuff that’s painful today because it’s frequent + operational (support, RevOps, CSM, finance ops), not really deep research or exploration. 2. Dashboards are great when questions are known and stable. Agents get interesting when the question is variable but still bounded, e.g. “why did churn risk spike for these 20 accounts?”, “summarize anomalies by segment”, “draft an escalation note with the relevant context,” etc. The way we're thinking is that these sandboxed, curated views/tools are guardrails - the agent still does the synthesis + narrative + next-step suggestions.3. We’re also treating schema exploration as a separate (higher risk) capability. I agree that to do real analyst work, you probably need: semantic layer + table relationships + multi-turn exploration. But letting an LLM roam your warehouse is also where we foresee getting: cost blowups, accidental joins into sensitive tables, hallucination and more. One more reason we’re starting constrained: **repeatability.** For some of the agent tasks we're aiming for, it’s almost mandatory for teams to yield the same answer for the same/similar questions (or at least the same underlying definition/query) every time. So our plan for now is: **start constrained → earn trust → expand surface area (curated views + sandboxing allows us to do that)** ideally with a semantic layer + policy checks as the expansion path.

What I've experimented more with is snowflake's 'cortex' ecosystem which allows you to do RBAC on curated views with semantic layers.

nuipac3,"All excellent questions.1. Cost and speed - I’m in the process of running benchmarks against progressively larger databases. So far, I’m seeing a maximum 10% overhead in storage for the VCS on the database. Cost is dependent on your architecture, but if we’re going with Aurora RDS, it’s dependent on IOPS. This solution uses Copy-on-Write, so there is an increase in IOPS over just running against production, but less than simply copying all the data. Since it’s also delta-based, the IOPS are only upserts, but those are ran twice (once on the branch, once on the merge into main).2. Difference with Git - generally, you don’t store data in Git outside of small test sets. This is a branch that essentially allows you to run your code in production without ever actually touching production. You connect to the same database, so you don’t need to modify your connection (beyond minor branch variables with can be set via environment). Subsetting your data can result in edge case failures since a subset by definition doesn’t include every case. 3. Blame - you can track blame for every record, every column and row, every constraint just by querying rather than digging into the CDC or building a proper SCD pipeline. 4. Silver bullet solution - that right there is the reason behind this post. I want genuine feedback from the community. I have worked at several jobs where this would be incredibly useful, but that’s only my limited experience. I know there are other, more targeted solutions for the various problems. I wanted to get a sense of others’ experiences to see if this addresses a genuine broad need, or if it’s overkill for the majority of problems. One issue I’ve faced constantly is the introduction of bad data into the production database via improperly structured code which might look fine in git but fails in weird ways when applied to the entire database. This allows you to not just review a PR of the code, but also a PR of the data changes at the same time.",cmcclu5,2025-12-17 14:49:23,1,dataengineering,t1_nuhbbj5,True,
nukczua,"Interesting, I do a lot of work with dev teams around logging, what I’ve found works for us is being clear on the exact code change, logic and format of it. We even help write test cases for them in some cases. We also have dev data flow into our data lake so we can validate and iterate dev data before production so it doesn’t break or mess anything up.This has taken a while to get into strong place for a lot of teams such as buy in from stakeholders, value output and context around what the code does so we can advise on the change, especially around the logger and implementation.For the case of having it tied to git sounds interesting, but we are large org, hundreds of repos and already well defined process for releasing code changes (not necessarily tied to data) so to add have the data change linked to PR would be difficult I think for us to introduce as the there’s a lot of teams, infrastructure and processing for us to validate. Ways we have gone to improve the feedback loop is to get the data show back to people as possible. So getting dev data back, tools to view logs as interactions happen and pushing to be advisors/partners on the logging side. Also running QA checks and validation on dev data to catch drift early has been a massive help to catch things. This is generally through strict types like struct types in spark or pydantic etcThis generally means data engineers try to partner with teams for a log change and setting guidelines and docs on best practices to follow for teams to be self serve. Once a change is implemented, DEs integrate and transform data for other downstream teams and analysts to consume.Definitely not a perfect solution, but has worked well for us. Starting over tomorrow, would I consider a data vcs? Maybe as a trial to experiment but probably not. Data is generally later phase concern when building a product/service unless the data is your product, but usually not the case.Having had to built a service for users and already a key stakeholder of the logging implementation, time spent on data logging was tough to prioritize as needed something built and out the door and made more sense to do after release as a follow up.Having typed structure really has been the biggest help.

nuay6y4,"So, let me tell ye about the old timey times.What we used to do is load pages in serial. Request came in, and as we processed the page, we'd make database requests, wait for the response, build more page, do more requests, etc. Not great. If you had a long loading page, it might takes 20 seconds or more to load.So we got async. Async was cool because now when a request comes in, I serve you a template and give you some URLs in my API to query. Each makes its own specific action and on completion does something else. Page loads in 0.5s, most of your data is there in <1s, and that one long 15-second query stalling out the old page eventually loads in when ready. Great!However, we ended up with edge cases. Your page loads a complex tab that needs data from 5 dynamic drop-downs that it also has to load data for. That's 5 requests that all get triggering in serial using async or .thens (aka callback hell), or you could hope for the best and occasionally end up with a race condition and a failed load.So we got promises. Honestly, for >90% of use cases, it just improved handling with then, catch, finally, etc. But it also enabled us to use Promise.all where we could cleanly write code, where we could call some nonsense like: function foo() { Promise.all([ getUserDropdownData(), getCityDropdownData(), getStateDropdownData(), getDepartmentDropdownData(), getSomeOtherData() ]) .then(values => { //doesn't execute until all of the above data is loaded const [userData, cityData, statedata, deptData, otherData] = values; buildUserDataDropdown(userData); buildCityDataDropdown(cityData); buildStateDataDropdown(stateData); buildDeptDataDropdown(deptData); buildOtherDataDropdown(otherData); }) .then(() => { //doesn't execute until we're done building all the dropdowns refreshTableData(); //...might have to add a 1ms timeout to grab default values accurately }) } /* disclaimer, I half tested this real quick with timeouts, may or may not work, example only */You would literally be tearing your eyes out to do that without promises; I'm talking 3-4x that many lines of code to sync all of it up. Also, with overhead, you might be waiting \~200ms for each request, so your drop-downs load in \~220ms instead of \~1000ms. Now we can cleanly make those requests in parallel without fear of race conditions, and request our table data even faster.We also got web workers; because Javascript is single-threaded it just executes whatever is at the top of the stack. If I have to do something that counts to...1 billion, that'll block the top of the stack while it counts, locking the rest of the page. If I assign it to a worker, the worker gets a separate thread from my main JS thread to do its task.And that's all I'm gonna say because I took way too long typing this.",Mike312,2025-12-16 08:45:09,9,learnprogramming,t3_1pnuj7k,False,
nub0kfo,"> Is multithreading considered “legacy” or risky now?Depends on the use case. Async doesn't help with CPU-bound work. Multithreading can.> Are async/event-driven models actually better for most scalable backends?Async is just a way to have a suspendable function. For backend, the theory is that we spend a lot of time waiting for slow IO. OS-provided threads tend to be heavyweight (e.g. every thread reserves memory for its call stack, and that tends to be O(MB) for each thread). So using them just to wait for slow IO is wasteful. If we instead move all that into userspace, we can avoid a lot of that overhead.> Or is this more about developer experience than performance?It's both, although async/await also has some downsides (mainly [the function coloring problem](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/)). Some languages / runtimes (like Erlang, Go, and Java) manage to avoid the function coloring problem.> A lot of blogs and talks make it sound like classic multithreading (threads, locks, shared state) is something people are actively trying to avoidI maintain that async is susceptible to many of the same issues that multithreaded code is susceptible to, but at a more coarse-grained level. If you have shared data that is being operated on by two in-flight `async` calls, then they will interleave with each other in unpredictable ways. You still want tools to e.g. block one async function from resuming while a different async function is busy updating some shared data.Because async/await has well-defined preemption points, you're not going to have a single memory location that is being read from and written to at the same time. But you _could_ be in the middle of updating a complex structure. Perhaps it's in an inconsistent state, but you need to call an async function before you can put it back in a consistent state. That's basically the same problem that exists in classical threading, with the same solution - you want something like a mutex.There's a reason that Go and Java (with virtual threads) both have mutex types, despite both supporting colorless async. Even then, you are encouraged to use higher-level tools if you can. But sometimes, you just need a mutex.",balefrost,2025-12-16 09:09:24,8,learnprogramming,t3_1pnuj7k,False,

nu5vonj,"SQL injection happens when you are able to identify that the receiving application does not sanitize the user input or limit permissions levels before passing it to the database (application is what authenticates to the database, not the end user). Take the following as an example loophole. The common SQL injection came from login pages, meaning the application would accept a username and password from the end user, then will check the database for matching records.An example of a poor and vulnerable way to handle the input / login process would be something like`Select TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = '{input.username}' AND Password = '{input.password}';`then accepting the record returned as the 'authenticated' user. Now, lets look at how the resulting query would work for a normal input as well as a malicious input. Lets say I put in ""John@Doe.com"" as the username and ""RubberDucky"" as the password. The application would pass the following to the database`SELECT TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = 'John@Doe.com' AND Password = 'RubberDucky'`fair enough, now what happens if i put in a username of ""Admin';--""? The application would pass the following `SELECT TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = 'Admin';-- ' AND Password = 'RubberDucky';`The database will return the first user that has the username of ""Admin"" and consider it to be authenticated because ' will finish my string input, "";"" would terminate the SQL command, and ""--"" comments out the rest to prevent any kind of syntax errors. that is just a very basic example. Another example i found in production (i work for this company and had permission) was they created an API that would allow you to pass in a SQL query to generate custom reports and such (HORRIBLE IDEA btw). To make it ""secure"" they used pattern matching and prevented commands like ""UPDATE"", ""DELETE"", ""\*"", etc. So as a proof of concept, i encoded my query in b64 and passed in a query that would decode and execute it to create tables, dump SQL user names, dump stored CC info, etc. I have also seen people do it in HEX Once you start spotting potential holes like this, the possibilities are endless as to what you can do.

I was signed up to NuCamp's newsletter and got an email that my city was offering a retraining scholarship, which meant I'd only have to pay $600 for 7 months of classes. Hard to pass that up.I did NuCamp from September 2024 to March 2025. It's designed to be a part-time program that you can do while you have a full-time job, but I'm not sure how realistic that is. I quit my job and went all in when we started React. Before the BootCamp, I was in tutorial hell, having done Free Code Camp, Harvard CS50, Odin Project, YouTube, and Udemy classes. I'll say that even with all that prep, the BootCamp was a firehose of information, and by the end of it, I was exhausted. I liked the classes. Most of the teachers I had were good. The Jobs class they offered was total trash IMO, but that could have been because of the teacher, who felt more like a social media influencer. That class did force me to finish my portfolio website, so it wasn't all bad. Their Discord is actively shouting out jobs. I ended up taking a few more months after class to wrap my head around React and get better at JavaScript by building projects and doing CodeWars. Over a year after starting, I'm now studying Front End Dev questions I pulled from GreatFrontEnd and dabbling with LeetCode, which has been incredibly frustrating. At best, I've probably got another six months of practice and projects before I'd be hireable, but realistically, I'm thinking I've got another year. I'm an artist, so this stuff comes slowly to me. Since you're already doing analytics, I'm guessing it will be faster for you.If you do the BootCamp, my advice is to do personal projects with people in your cohort. That was probably the MOST beneficial part of the BootCamp. Looking at my group's code and trying to make everything work together really forced me to understand it and broke me out of tutorial hell.Another tip I'd give is to grab a BootCamp class off of Udemy when it's discounted and work your way through it to see how you do.

Though, it usually means that we need to do one of two ""not nice"" things stylistically: (a) we need to increase indentation for the non-error case, or (b) we need to use a goto at the error point (or throw an exception), which many people find not nice, but rarely say the explicit reason for their aversion to it.In your particular example that you cited, the early return is not really an ""error case"", though, so in this particular example, placing both the returns at the same indentation level (i.e. one within in the ""if"" branch and the other within the ""else"" branch) would make the \*intent\* slightly clearer.Now, suppose you wanted to amend the function and include some kind of ""error condition"" like for the value 0 (which is mathematically neither even nor odd). In such a case like that, then in my opinion it would be clearer to use an early return for that, since doing so ""idiomatically"" expresses the idea that this kind of situation is an unexpected or unusual case. I.e., maybe the caller made some kind of mistake by asking whether 0 is even or odd, because logically that may make no sense, so maybe it's a mistake that it was asked.Once the ""error returns"" are taken care of, the rest of the code can basically assume (correctly) that the value in question is ""correct"" in terms of logicality. I.e. for this function it means the rest of the code can assume we are dealing with non-zero quantities, which almost always helps analyzing the correctness of the algorithm.",chaotic_thought,2025-12-17 08:08:00,20,learnprogramming,t3_1poqy8r,False,

nuheww5,"At the end of the day, it's style and philosophy of whatever you're working on.There's something more general than what you describe as ""checks if all parameters are set,"" but you've got the right idea for a lot of cases - a lot of functions deal on large sets of inputs, and by conditionally handling easier subsets early, you can save more complex logic for lower in the function body.Here's a case I encounter a lot where I strongly prefer an ""early out"" if early in the method body - an if/else where there's a trivial branch that has to live in the programmers brain as they track through which conditional they're in: // Try to guess the user's first name, return a generic name if it can't be inferred String guessFirstNameFromEmail(String emailAddress) { if (isValidEmailAddress(emailAddress)) { String username = emailAddress.split(""@"")[0].filter(Filter.Letters); if (username != """") { if (username.contains(""."")) { return username.split(""."")[0]; } else if (hasUpperAndLowerLetterMix(username)) { return username.splitBy(SplitMethod.CapitalLetters)[0]; } else { return username; } } else { return ""Sam""; } } else { return ""Alex""; } }That method is *fine* functionally, but at a quick glance what is the condition that hits the line `return ""Sam"";`? What happens if an email address doesn't match the ""`isValidEmailAddress`"" check?It's a bit easier to read, both in terms of lowering mental strain and indenting depth, if you take simple cases and pull them out like this: // Try to guess the user's first name, return a generic name if it can't be inferred String guessFirstNameFromEmail(String emailAddress) { if (!isValidEmailAddress(emailAddress)) { return ""Alex""; } if (username == """") { return ""Sam""; } if (username.contains(""."")) { return username.split(""."")[0]; } if (hasUpperAndLowerLetterMix(username)) { return username.splitBy(SplitMethod.CapitalLetters)[0]; } return username; }In the lower case, it's more of a series of deductions - you're considering your assumptions first, and it reads more like getting ""weird"" cases out of the way first (bad input, empty string, etc...).",sessamekesh,2025-12-17 09:03:30,3,learnprogramming,t3_1poqy8r,False,

E.g.: def fizzbuzz(number: int) -> str: result = """" if number % 3 == 0: result += ""Fizz"" if number % 5 == 0: result += ""Buzz"" if result == """": result = str(number) return result In this example you could return the final value both in the second and third if-statement, but if you change the function and a third condition like ```if number % 7 == 0: result += ""Razz""```then you would have to also change the statement in the Buzz-branch even though your change had nothing to do with the Buzz part of the logic.",Achereto,2025-12-17 08:43:40,2,learnprogramming,t3_1poqy8r,False,

For that reason, we'll have one return at the end of the function, and use a temporary variable to store the return value. You don't need to have a crazy nested if-else structure for this. Just set the temporary return variable to some value (like null) when you create it. As soon as you hit a return situation, set the variable to some non-null value.

nu9zyvl,"The basic idea is: every program consists of objects that have properties and do things. Sometimes they interact with each other. Sometimes they even make more objects.Then there are four ""pillars"": encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.1. Encapsulation is when an object's properties are hidden to the public, and optionally only exposed through some kind of filter. These are most commonly seen as `get` and `set` methods.2. Inheritance is when one type of object is a ""subclass"" of another (""superclass""), so every property and method of the latter also belongs to the former. 3. Abstraction is when you hide the internals of how something works, and just expose the inputs and outputs. This is far from exclusive to OOP; chances are you're already used to this. 4. Polymorphism is when you refer to the same object using different types to get different information from it. In the same ""subclass"" relationship used for inheritance, every object of type subclass is also of type superclass.That's it, that's OOP!

Their main YT channel also has several long video tutorials and crash-courses to my knowledge.There is also lots of videos all over YouTube about most programming topics / concepts, computer science, as well as specific tutorials on projects.Second, unfortunately, reading is just a part of programming as I am sure you're aware. You're going to have to read requirements of projects and their documentation, as well as write it. You're going to have to read code and genuinely try to understand it, both the functions and the larger whole. You're going to have to read documentation of the programming languages, tools, and APIs you're using.I'm not saying that to shame you, God knows, I barely read books. But reading is very much a part of programming, from the learning to the actual process of doing.Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp are both what I have experience with. They're both solid platforms, and I'd probably complete FCC first, and then circle back to Odin Project and see about the gaps and more advanced knowledge it covers. One of the big advantages is that it is fairly unguided and gives you a set of objectives to complete. This forces you to think about what you're doing, how and why, as well as forcing you to acquire knowledge and documentation just like you would on any real project.At that point, I'd probably just try making projects. Maybe dabble in a game engine like Godot because of its lightweight nature, GDScript which is very easy to read and write, and ability to do web exports for Itch.IO. Hell you can even use it to make applications / tools, not games, but I digress.I'm just not sure what to suggest that can fulfill that video requirement, besides trying a hybrid approach. Try to at least read the highlights and general idea of a topic, and then look for some videos about it, maybe practical examples. Don't force yourself to deathmarch paragraph after paragraph, but I don't know if you can truly avoid reading either.I'm sure others know more, I mostly learned by messing around modding games, reading books, nibbling on these tutorial sites and such.

ACs should cover: inputs (clicks, path parameters, query parameters, etc), authentication/authorization (which types of users can do this, what happens if it is not authorized), outputs (status codes, formats such as JSON/XML, schema), how to handle error states (bad inputs, server errors, etc.), validation, navigation (what happens after a user clicks a thing). They won't necessarily cover everything, but everything that they don't cover should be ""dealer's choice"", i.e. they shouldn't matter to the end user, if they do, then it should be in the AC.For your example:AC1: Make a GET endpoint /orders that returns a JSON response matching the schema ...

I have been using w3schools, and although they may or may not be the best that can be found, my hope is that it will bridge the gap between the great books on the subject and the recent changes to the language.

nupbj6f,"The core idea of OOP is to associate data with behaviour. E.g. instead of having a `sort()` function that sorts a list of data based on an algorithm, your data has it's own `sort()` method, so it kind of sorts itself instead of getting sorted.On first glance this sounds very powerful, because a list of strings may be sorted differently than a list of numbers or a list of pointers. What OOP allows you is to have a list of any type, just call `.sort()` on it and the correct sorting method will be used automagically.This idea was then further applied to other things like a Date. Instead of using a library of functions and a collection of structs that the functions work on, you now get an object and have all functions directly associated with that object, so instead of writing `dateutils.to_string(date: Date, ...)` you now have `Date.to_string(...)`. In the early days of OOP this was used for code reuse through inheritance. Inheritance just means, that you define a new class and tell the computer that this class should have all the features of that parent class plus the new stuff you define and except the stuff you redefine in the new class.However, it turned out that Inheritance doesn't work well for code reuse, so nobody sane recommends it any more for that. It also turned out that it's more common to have different behaviour than different kind of data, so people started using ""Composition"" instead. Composition just means that your objects has other objects that are used to perform different kind of behaviour. For Example, you may have a class `Animal` and the animal is supposed to have different behaviour like walk, run, speak, eat. Instead of using Inheritance to create new subclasses of `Animal` and implement different behaviour, you define small interfaces `IRunner`, `IWalker`, `ISpeaker`, `IEater` (or similar) and write small classes for each interface. There might be a `Bark` and a `Meow` class implementing ""ISpeaker` and there may be ""BipedRunner"" and ""QuadrupedRunner"" implementing ""IRunner"" and so on. You then create different animals using the Animal-Constructor:```pycat = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Meow(), CarnivoreEater())dog = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Bark(), CarnivoreEater())horse = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Whinny(), HerbivoreEater())cat.speak() # ""meow!""dog.speak() # ""wruff!""horse.speak() # ""neigh!""```This is what ""Composition over Inheritance"" refers to. So we're almost back to having functions applied to data, but instead we call a method of an object that then looks up another object and calls one of that object's methods (for each individual method call).A big downside of OOP is that contrary to its promise it makes code harder to maintain, because you create a compile time hierarchy that matches your domain model and with that you create boundaries around things (objects) instead of creating boundaries around properties (e.g. positions, prices, ... ).

It is not any more high school where teachers would remind you to do your assignments and such. Now you have to learn how to live an independent life and make your own decisions. When I was doing my Bachelor studies then some of my course mates dropped out within the first two semesters. Some partied too much. Some had no self-discipline. Some found out that they picked a wrong field. etc. About skills more, then become proactive. Do not rely just on your courses. Participate in hackathons. Join a programming/robotics club. Work on hobby projects. Because by the time you graduate you'll have to compete with everybody else. And then you have to stand out somehow, to be hired.And, do not rely on an AI.

Oh, and do not try to hack your university's/college's systems.

nur1lr8,"Funny story I actually just answered a very similar question is the cs majors sub lol I will paste my answer here:First, if you want to study cs get a cs degree and then specialize after. From my experience and talking to professionals degrees like cybersecurity, information systems, and data science (do a stats major instead) are not as good.As for knowing what you want to specialize in I don't think there are any shortcuts besides trying stuff and seeing if you like it. Either take a class or build a project and see if it's cool. You can also research online about the different cs disciplines. If you decide on embedded systems I think computer or elctrical engineering is a better major, but it prob depends on the school.Regarding how economically cooked the different cs subdisciplines are, they honestly aren't that cooked. What's (or rather who) is cooked is the person who graduates, has no extracurricular experience, and is only interested in the doing bare minimum to get money.The truth is that cs isn't an easy path to 6 figures. You either need to genuinely like it or be very disciplined because the degree is only like 30-40% of the puzzle. Join tech clubs, do competitive programming/leetcode, build stuff, and give it your all! It's such a cool subject that touches all the sciences, math, and unifies it under this neat idea of very clearly describing a process.PS: Maybe it's just personal bias but it seems that web dev is the most vulnerable to AI. There's hella ai tools like replit and loveable that can already handle most basic-intermediate apps. Also if you want to be immune to ai get a job writing like cobol for a bank or visual basic for some unc company.Now specifically regarding some stuff you asked: You should stay general until you know what you like, at least until like you finish your first year or two of uni. You'll have enough time to skill up specifically for your interest. Focus on fundamentals and you'll be flexible enough to pivot. Also, even if you end up going into like embedded, building a website will still make you a better and more well rounded programmer.",lo0nk,2025-12-18 21:14:44,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ppxaa6,False,

AI is the latest hot thing today, but who knows what will be the next thing a year or two from now? Maybe the AI bubble will have already popped by then, and if you specialize in AI early on, based on current trends, you'll be left on ice.So be a generalist in your studies and only specialize once you enter the workforce.

You may find that you need other things along the way like a database, but thats just another external package and another set of docs.

You would find it on your 4th iteration and return true.Let's say you wanted to do binary search instead So first step, you cut the array in half. N / 2 = 2.5, so we just pick index 2.There's a 3 there, which isn't what we want. So we compare if it's higher or lower than 4.Since 3 is lower than 4, and we know the array is sorted, then we know that 4 is in the right half of the array[4 5]. Now, N = 2So you cut the array in half again. N/2 = 1, and at index 1, there's the number 5. It's higher than 4, so we have to cut in half again[4]Now there's only one element, and it's the number we want, so we return true.You will see that we had to cut the array in half only 3 times before we found it.Binary search has complexity O(log N) because the number of times we need to iterate with respect to the magnitude of the input (in this case, the number of elements in the array) is log (base 2) of N The things that are important when it comes to big O runtime complexity is to1. Identify how you're measuring the input2. Draw out each step of the algorithm3. Determine the amount of steps you would have in the worst case.For linear search, the worst case is having to check every element. So given N elements, you perform N iterations.In the case of binary search, since you're cutting the number of elements to search in half every iteration, you only need search log(base 2) N times, plus the one if there are odd number of elements.",mxldevs,2025-12-14 18:02:02,1,learnprogramming,t1_nu078lc,False,

Run it on GitHub Pages so now it is on the Internet too. Good stuff to learn to get that far. Then add the next small thing by adding a backend server and modify your TODO application to POST tasks there instead. POST, GET, UPDATE, DELETE are REST verbs you can learn about. Just print the tasks to the console for now. Once you have that working add a database and save a POSTed task to the database using SQL. INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE are SQL statements that map directly to the REST verbs and they are often referred to as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Fill in the GET (SELECT) request to retrieve your tasks, the UPDATE, then DELETE. Now your application is full stack.Let the projects you pick guide what you need to learn, when you need to learn it. MDN is a great resource for the frontend and there are many great resources for whatever backend and database you choose.As you build this, you are doing all of this locally, frontend, backend, database, and committing changes to git and pushing those changes to your GitHub repo as you go. To get your GitHub Pages frontend to talk to your backend running on your local machine you can learn about CORS (allows your frontend to talk to your backend) to add that to your backend then use \`ngrok\` to temporarily expose your server and port to the internet (only works while \`ngrok\` and your computer are running).Now that you have a full stack application running on the Internet, time to learn about authentication to make it so only registered users can access your server. You will add login/logout to your frontend and backend as well as user management. More REST and CRUD stuff to add for that too.Cloud stuff is next to get all of it running on the internet. That is a later topic.Whatever projects you pick, build projects as completely as you can. Make them full stack if that is your thing.

nu4ufej,"Picture yourself in the early 1980s. There is no internet. There barely are any knowledgeable people in your area. Formal programming education is basically non existent before University.All you have is the *documentation manual* for the programming language.How do you learn?Through experimentation. You have no resources, so the only thing you can do is play around, try things. Fail. Try more. Fail again. Try more and eventually succeed.You won't learn by copying tutorial or stackoverflow, etc. code. You will only learn by creating your own code, even if that means that your solutions are maybe complicated, convoluted, and sub-optimal. Yet, they are *your* solutions. They stem from *your thought process*. This way, you *learn*.Once you have a working solution, there is no harm in looking up how others have solved the problems. This way, you can learn better, more optimized approaches. Yet, first *you* need to figure out a solution.The notion of directly looking for solutions via the internet is detrimental to learning, even more so in the current age of permanent availability of the internet, and worse, with the advent of AI. It makes us lazy. It makes us stopping to think analytically. It makes us stop investing effort, because ""why should we when everything is readily available?"". In return, it makes us stop actually *learning*. Learning means struggling. Learning means failing. Learning means debugging. Learning does not mean getting a solution from effectively a third party (no matter if Google, Stackoverflow, AI, etc.)Discipline yourself to not looking for direct solutions and even less *in code*, but to look for *approaches* to solutions. Maybe, download the documentation for your programming language and then cut yourself off the internet. Seems like a radical step, but can be extremely helpful for learning.The thought process from problem to solution is what really counts in programming, not the *implementation* in a programming language (that's the more trivial part and just a necessary evil).Once you understand how to ""think like a programmer"" things change considerably. Programming languages become less important and you learn to work on a more abstract, conceptional level.Maybe, try some programming competitions, like [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) (with the accompanying subreddit /r/adventofcode) - current year is over, but the challenges are all accessible back to the very first season in 2015. Another recommendable site is [Exercism](https://exercism.org). Here, you get challenges and have ""hints"" and guidance.As usual with such posts (of which there are more than plenty), some Literature (aka *books*):+ ""Think Like A Programmer"" by V. Anton Spraul+ ""The Pragmatic Programmer"" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas+ ""Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman+ ""Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software"" by Charles PetzoldTo address your ""all coders do is just copy-paste"" statement: yes, we do copy paste, but not because we *could not do the job*, it's because of time constraints, trusted and tested solutions. Contrary to a beginner/learner, we can assess what a solution copied from the internet does, how it fits into our codebase, what side effects it has, etc. We could come up with our own solutions, but that would be less efficient in a professional setting than to resort to tested and trusted solutions.",aqua_regis,2025-12-15 10:24:10,16,learnprogramming,t3_1pmzjoe,False,

Those compositions could also have their own inheritance tree.For your arguments1. one of the fundamental aspects of OOP is that child classes can have more methods than the parent provides.

Even as a jr, document everything you do. Just finished a big project? Most jobs use a documentation system where you can just look up how to do things.

nue3wly,"I can explain since I work with a said “Good Software Engineer” currently. I’ve been at my current position (my first one since outside of college) for about a year and 10 months give or take. From working there so far, I have worked with two really good engineers. Both of them have had two totally different experiences, but surprisingly, both have ended up in the same place doing the exact same thing. One of them was a self taught developer who tinkered with programming at a young age and learned many languages. Unfortunately, he didn’t pursue a CS degree because he grew up very poor but is in the works of getting one right now. This dude had many personal projects under his belt and worked extensively outside of work getting tasks at work completed. He had around 15 years of experience working with software and loved programming. He knew embedded programming really well too including how PLCs work and loved learning new things about programming. The other had a CE degree from Michigan Tech and has around 15 years of experience. He worked with embedded programming for the bulk of his career at GE Aviation. He really enjoys learning about new technologies and currently is helping us bring into the modern era an older application. This dude is my current mentor and has taught me so much in terms of how to program and ultimately, how to go about architecting and designing programs. He is a monster, he designed a completely new product from an older application at my company and reverse engineered the way it works so that it translated properly to a new language and environment. My coworkers had told him that the old project was a mess since it was written with a very old version of C++ (to most of us it was a mess lol). But he straight up in the interview said “nothing scared him”. My bosses laughed at him but he proved US ALL wrong. The thing about both of them that made them really good engineers was that both of them explicitly stated to me that all they did was “breathe and live” code. They programmed on all their free time and worked many hours outside of the usual 40 hour work week perfecting their craft. They read books, watched videos, they absorbed so much information on their free time that it clearly showed when they came into work ready to start their day. Like I feel helpless sometimes just seeing that they can take on so many tasks (especially tough ones) and my tasks I complete are mediocre at best.

nuekw0t,"Yes, live interviews require a separate (but complementary) skill-set from the problem-solving & knowledge acquisition which are typically the key take-aways from private self-study. It may take less time to develop than technical skills, it depends on where you're at with things like handling stress, communication etc. It feels longer because people tend to, unwittingly, neglect it until they've bombed several interviews.The key thing is that self-study conditions are radically different from real interviews. There's no one breathing down your neck while you problem-solve. The time pressure, high stakes, and interviewers disrupting your thought process aren't simulated. This is often why people brain freeze in interviews.Do mock interviews alongside your self-study to identify your weaknesses, and ideally start them early so you have more time to fix issues.

nu20qch,"Idk, I never struggled to find a job either… until this year. Always had backlogs of recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn, even though I never posted/updated/said I was looking for work. I think there’s a few factors at play that make the job market seem extra shitty right now.1. Layoffs/hiring freezes across big tech, and government jobs. Basically a large pool of people who would have been considered ‘Top Talent’ a few years ago are now all looking for work at once. The longer they are unemployed, the lower the standards get, so even if you are just applying for ‘Regular’ jobs, a few of the 100+ resumes in that inbox probably has ‘Google’ or ‘Meta’ or whatever on it. 2. With AI, it’s become trivial to spam out resumes, and tailor/frame your work experience to the exact job requirements. If you just earnestly apply to jobs, you are unlikely to get an interview even if you are a relatively good fit. You said ‘SQL’ on your resume. Someone else mentioned the exact distribution they use at the company. You said ‘AWS’ they said the exact AWS features and tech stack being used. Often times your resume won’t even make it past the screening stage.3. Just general hiring trends. Hiring tends to be forward looking, so I think a lot of senior leadership is really leaning into the idea that they should be able to accomplish more with the same amount of people. Instead of increasing headcount by 10% for some new project, they’ll try to push AI tools and re-org the ‘freed up’ employees to whatever new project they are working on.It’s definitely pretty rough. Even with 8+ years of backend dev and Data Science experience, I’ve applied to ~100+ jobs. One final round of interviews, no job offers, and I only got there because I had a referral. I’ve started just not bothering with jobs that list even one specific technology I don’t have experience with.I’m not saying I’m a super talented top dev. I’ve always worked at middle of the road non tech F500 companies. But I’ve never been fired or even had a bad performance review. I’d be so excited to just get the feedback ‘Yo, you didn’t do a good job solving this LC problem. Or your architecture skills and thought process isn’t what we are looking for’. But it’s just like… no one even gives you a chance to interview if you don’t BS your resume with AI.

Location is a major factor.In markets like New York or Silicon Valley, you have people who have sacrificed years of their lives to prep for demanding positions, so every role that gets posted has a ton of competition. When candidates get dumped onto the market from layoffs, companies have to ratchet up the difficulty in interviews just to have a manageable pipeline.I've been involved in the recruiting for a team that is not in a tech hub. In-person work is a hard requirement, for about \~150k base salary, no stocks, no bonus. It's probably average for that area, but not particularly attractive for someone to move just for the job. We even offer relocation assistance for that role.We get maybe 20 candidates per job posting, half of which are not qualified because they need sponsorship. If we interview 10 people, about 1/2 can actually write a basic loop. We hire whoever has the best systems design interview since most people can not clear even a LeetCode easy. (clear rate for a fully passing solution is probably about 5% of all candidates that reach that stage).I really think unemployed engineers who are having trouble securing an offer for months have the wrong strategy.

Then you had boot camps generating devs that could do one thing okay quickly. Many devs don’t have cs degrees and a lot of those guys are actually pretty solid. The tech has gotten increasingly complex. The output expectations have increased. The quality of peers has declined. Interview intensity has gone way up. There is the expectation now that ai just makes it all happen magically and that we will be eliminated soon anyways. Dollar is worth less. There was a time you could be good at one part of the stack and be paid well. Now the expectation is your good at fe, be, observability, continuous integration, testing, deployment, wireframes, reqs & documentation, etc. It used to be if the codebase was a mess or you weren’t familiar with some framework they would cut you slack of train you but less so now. It used to be a few devs in a room working through stuff. Now everyone’s remote on different continents crammed into tiny noisy apartments. You’re still supposed to manage to mentor them.  Usually most of the team has already been outsourced so they really don’t have the same skin in the game and your heads on the chopping block. The interview used to focus on your degree, likability, location, and experience.  It went from white boarding to take home test and live coding exams to leet code with ai graders kidding your voice and eye movements.

The expectation of 2x ai productivity doesn’t account for the quality of the ai, existing code, or clarity of instructions. Then there is pay. It’s held strong in a way and even grown faster than other industries but the dollar is worth under 1/3 as much as ten years ago in terms of shelter, transportation, healthcare, and food. Then there’s the increase in domestic cs degrees coming online and the over hiring in the covid market rally which went to layoffs then to ai hiring. I’ve had 6 jobs in ten years and everyone has laid us off or been bought out. Some were productive, some kept the companies software alive, others had no idea what they wanted. Can definitely make you tired. But that’s why it’s a job, right? Made some money.

At my last job I was involved in hiring, and we would always get at least 1,000 applications in the first 24 hours after posting, usually we'd end up with 3-5k. We started with a code screen, basically a couple LC easy questions, that usually got us down to a few hundred. Then we'd divvy up the resumes and mark them as reject or pass. It was a quick glance maybe 5 seconds each resume to see if they had the basic qualifications, the vast majority of those failed. Then we'd be down to \~20-50 people and we'd have our HR do a phone screen, basically ask about their basic qualifications, make sure they're interested in the job at the salary range we're offering and the tech stack they'd be working on. We rarely rejected anyone in this round but many took themselves out of the running so typically we'd be down to 10-20 at that point. Then we'd have the hiring manager have a phone screen with them. If they made it to this point they had something on their resume we liked, so we'd typically ask them about it and really drill down and ask for excruciating detail to make sure they actually did it. Spoiler alert, most people are exaggerating and/or lying about their specific contribution to a project on their resume, and it's super easy to weed out. That got us down to \~5 which we would invite to interview.Once we selected to interview them, I would then read a cover letter if they sent one, although I think a lot of other folks didn't even read them then. This is also the point I would look at their github if they had one on their resume or anything else they included as side projects. I think I was one of the few people involved in hiring who did any of that most would just look at the resume 10 minutes before the interview. Then the interview was with a few folks, we had one do a tech screen where we give them a sample problem and watch them code, change requirements and see how they adapt. One does a culture fit interview where they ask questions related to soft skills, how do you handle conflict, those types of questions. One is a business round where our product person asks them some questions related to our business and some basic logic questions to see if they can reason through product requirement type things. Then everyone meets and ranks the candidates, we come up with a consensus order, and send the offer out to the first one, if they decline send the offer to the second one, etc. It's also possible at that point that some people just get a fail so even if they're the highest rated candidate we'd rather restart the process than hire them, although that's rare most people who've made it to this stage are at least getting hired if they're the best candidate interviewing for that role who accept because as you can see it's a long and painful process and we'd rather not start over.",Inner_Butterfly1991,2025-12-18 05:42:44,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1ppbbyg,False,

Another person instead recommended me to write a cover letter, as it is a way to stand out, especially for relatively junior roles with many applicants.If you're submitting an application, you are selling yourself. No salesperson in the history of ever has tried to get their counterpart to just read the product description. They want face time, to tell the story of their product, to make an emotional appeal.Do you think they send out empty e-mails, with just the technical specs attached and the words ""for your kind consideration""? Or do you think they will use every sentence, every square inch of screen real-estate that they can get to make the other side interested in a conversation?Why on earth would anyone believe that the proven process would work differently when the opportunity you want them to grasp is yourself?For what it's worth, I currently going through my first hiring process on the employer side - I am sitting past an HR filter, so I don't even know if there were any cover letters; I wasn't giving any. But I can tell you this: The majority (of a very, very small pool) of CVs I have seen would not get a pass from me; there's too many slightly reddish flags, and as desperate as I am to work with a larger team, I simply don't have the time to allow someone to correct the misconceptions that their CV has created in the first place.But I would have read a cover letter; I would have read a slightly more detailed CV, and some of the things that tripped me up could have potentially been explained away. Who we invite is not entirely my choice, but I do get a say.And your problem is: I don't aim to be fair, I don't give a damn about giving you a chance. I care about filling a vacancy with someone who primarily has the right skills, enough experience and who I can stand having to talk to a few times a week.And if I know one thing it is this: Once we do hire someone, I lose my voice. I can't get them fired if I think they're a dud, or hard to get along with, so - for my own sake - I have to be very careful and weigh working in a team that's too small vs. working with someone I don't want to work with.And then, neither a CV or a cover letter take eons to write, or to customize for a specific position. Make your documents modular; have blocks that you can shift around if needed, and templates that you can remove or include.Believe me, I write cover letters when I apply for jobs. I have zero proof and no data to show that they work - but I really don't see a world where it's not worth the bit of extra effort.",okayifimust,2025-12-18 00:03:40,11,cscareerquestions,t3_1ppbbyg,False,

Be very aware of little problems you have or others have and constantly ask, is there a digital solution for this problem?Constantly being aware and asking that question is part of it. The other part is throwing crap against the wall and seeing what sticks. You can be surprised what winds up working versus what you thought would work and was a great idea. What you are trying to do is find the outlier event in a large distribution - and that requires many, many trials until you hit it.You'll never know if you don't test many innumerable ideas out in reality. The trick is to run these tests (as many as possible) without bankrupting your self and keeping the overhead low. One good principle to hold to is: ""what I think will work is irrelevant, what works is the only relevant thing"" - in other words, be REACTIVE and not PRO-ACTIVE. See if something might work - test it like a scientist with a hypothesis and then act based on objective observation.

As a junior engineer, you can't decide this, but you can get the conversation going. ""Hey, what happens if...?""Second, if there is no such procedure in place, then - all things being equal - I'm probably going to the concert. If it's one I could stand to miss, then maybe I'm making an offer: Cover the cost of my tickets plus something for the trouble. Something like that. But me helping you above and beyond the normal agreement is a favor, and sometimes I'm not in a position to grant you that favor. Boundaries are important.However, I'm also going to try to be accommodating within reason. In a situation like that, I'd offer to check in when I get back from the concert. If the issue's still ongoing, then perhaps some responsibility could be handed off to me so that others can get a break. This is probably really helpful as a junior, because while you might not be the best help for the initial incident, there can often be follow-up work that is less intensive. Like someone needs to run a database query every five minutes and make sure A stays less than B, until we can get the alert automation in place. And if I'm on the primary crew and I've been at it for six hours and a junior comes in at midnight and says, ""How can I help?"" you bet I'll hand that over and get some sleep.Finally, there's also the issue of Emergency Theatre. Do we really need all hands on deck? Or do we need the appearance that we're busting our butts to get it working again? There's not much you can do about this in the moment except recognize it and deal with it later. Figure out why this is the case.

nu4kaw5,"If another developer’s actions create obstacles that make your work more difficult, it is reasonable to raise those obstacles with your manager or whoever can address them. The focus should stay on the obstacle that is blocking you, not on the developer as a person.This framing positions you as someone trying to improve results for the company by identifying obstacles, rather than as someone “reporting” on a coworker. It avoids unnecessary interpersonal conflict and reduces the risk of backlash if your manager interprets it as a personal complaint.If the other developer’s behavior does not produce obstacles that actually impede your work, it is usually best to ignore it. Spending time and energy evaluating another person’s work habits is a distraction from producing strong results yourself.**Responding to your edit:** you’re saying that when your coworkers don’t do their work, you end up working overtime and feeling pressure to meet deadlines. That overtime and deadline pressure is the real obstacle being created by their lack of follow-through.That’s understandably frustrating. The right response is to communicate clearly with your manager about project status and work allocation. When work is assigned but not completed, you should state that the project is off track, explain that tasks are being reallocated, and explicitly note either that you are working overtime to meet deadlines or that deadlines will slip as a result of the reallocation.This gives your manager the opportunity to recognize and credit your extra effort, or to see that deadlines are being missed because work isn’t getting done and needs to be reassigned. Ideally, this leads them to independently notice that a particular coworker is consistently not completing their work.If your manager does not acknowledge your overtime and instead simply pressures you to work harder, then the issue is poor management.

It helps to understand the difference between hard and soft interrupts, how registers work and why for example ""boolean"" data won't likely save any actual memory vs an int...or if it does why it's now slower than an int.It's *always* beneficial to understand what is going on under the hood of the higher level constructs you're using.

Our embedded devices monitored data centers and we rarely ever had issues.My mentors were the writings of Scott Meyers, John Carmack and so on and a ton of cheat sheets (mostly effective C++ checklists) on the desk.Years later I got into a big company for the first time through Startup acquisition and we still regularly run into troubles for not following procedures.But honestly we usually can't wait for 2 months to deploy some crap if a customer wants to test it in 2 weeks.And our startup stuff isn't being touched anymore and has been running happily for years now.At the same time anytime anything is done ""the right way"", the whole web of k8s and whatnot breaks every single time right before a customer demo and nobody knows how to solve it because the people knowing the infra and k8s and the people knowing the app and the people knowing the customers and so on are completely different.At the same time our own apps that we just run pretty naively on AWS just...

He didn't use version control.This isn't normal, but I don't think it's completely unique, as you hear stories about people who have this experience. In the old days, teams were responsible for their own IT and work, and you'd have teams spring up like this all across departments, until they brought in someone to organize everything. I should probably say ""if"" rather than ""until."" Large organizations also go through something like this, so don't feel too self-conscious. Is there are larger tech community/team in your company? A part of me wants to say you should ask about joining them, but the new manager might be a pain. You should consider looking for other opportunities, as you're probably not learning good software practices. To counter that, perhaps you can allocate time for process improvement. You can sell it as ways to allow others to do your work. So, things like version control (I hope you're already using this, right?), CI/CD, some type of wiki for documentation, a ticketing/tracking system are some good starts. Maybe some next things to consider is how do you monitor things in Production? Just look at log files? I also want to clarify something. Just because a company has this stuff in place doesn't mean they do a good job with it. During the interview process, it's on you to try to figure out if places do a good job or not. Good luck, as some places will flat out lie to you. My last job is an example.

For the other I was building ML models in Azure which was a lot better (I stuck with that rotation post tdp). I think the biggest downside is that the pay stagnates super hard post TDP if you dont end up in a good title. Some of my friends came out as senior software engineers around 140k, others (like me) came out with much less glamorous titles doing roughly the same work at 110k. Pay disparity was just a function of what business unit you ended up in and what titles that business unit would allow.

The thinking goes: if I can’t get a job as a SWE, I’ll just *drop down* a rung or two and get one of those jobs.

nu5za02,"You’re not crazy for considering this, and you’re also not failing at SWE. The market for new grads has just been brutal, especially if you didn’t get a return offer lined up before graduating.Going into IT is a totally reasonable move if you treat it as a bridge, not a dead end. GeekSquad + Network+ + cloud certs can absolutely move you toward DevOps or SRE if you keep one foot in software. Plenty of people have gone IT → sysadmin → DevOps once they could show scripting, automation, and cloud work.The key is to not stop building or talking like an engineer. Keep shipping small projects, automate stuff at work if you can, write scripts, mess with CI/CD, cloud deployments, monitoring. That’s what makes the transition believable later. If you fully pivot away from coding for a few years, it’s harder to come back.Also, you’re doing a lot right already. Hackathons, freelance, startup, networking, referrals, interviews. The lack of offers isn’t because you’re weak, it’s just timing and competition. IT can give you income, experience, and momentum while the market recovers.One thing I’ve learned is that interviews reward people who can clearly explain what they’ve built and why.

Just practice and make sure it doesn’t come off like ‘I learned this just for this interview and never actually used any of this’.",__2moreweeks__,2025-12-18 15:42:16,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1pmzsvu,False,

nun5p5n,"I started my career in my state's Department of Education before pivoting to FAANG. My biggest recommendation would be to reach out to recruiters, though the state of the industry right now makes that a little rough. But every offer I've ever received aside from my first, I got because a recruiter was advocating for me. Also, connections in a company help a ton. If you have any friends from college, or friends of a friend, who work in big tech, there's usually a way they can endorse or refer you. That should get you fast-tracked. Good luck. Like I said, the industry is rough right now. Recruiters got hit pretty hard in the last round of lay-offs and the ones who are left don't have many positions to fill.",Infamous_Birthday_42,2025-12-18 05:44:46,9,cscareerquestions,t3_1ppiqmq,False,

You have too many devs at that experience level with experience at top companies that are struggling.My recommendation would be to reach out to recruiters and hiring managers, at tier 2/3 type companies. An example being JPMC, Mastercard, Intuit, etc.. Especially places that work heavily with Java. Once you work there for 2 years, then start going for top tech companies.

nttjf3w,"C++ and python are the two most widely used languages in robotics.  It's mostly python then c++ where speed or hardware interactions are done.  Lots of libraries, I'd recommend looking at ROS.  You can use gazebo and ROS tutorials to do a lot of robotics programming with no actual robot. Some of it depends on your interest.  Do you like more mechatronics and hardware or higher level stuff like navigating and planning.  Generally there's too much to a robot to go over all robotics programming in depth.  It's best to find an area that interests you and dive into it.",EruditusCodeMonkey,2025-12-13 14:46:50,7,cscareerquestions,t3_1plm3z2,False,

Math topics like linear algebra, statistics, and especially machine learning are highly relevant.Basically, robotics is a field where a relevant masters' or PhD are beneficial because it needs such a good foundation of math, programming, and engineering.
