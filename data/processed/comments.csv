Basically involves: setting pipelines to copy data from operational databases into analytical databases (+ setting up jobs to pre-calculate tables for analysis team)Data size: a few TBs in total, but daily ingestion of < 1Gb.Stack: AWS Lambda (in Python) to write data from AWS RDS as parquet in S3 (triggered by EventBridge daily); (at the moment) Snowflake Tasks to ingest data from S3 into raw layer in Snowflake; Dynamic Tables to create tables in Snowflake from its Raw layer up to user's consumption; PowerBI as BI tool.Architecture choice was to divide our data movement in 2 main parts: \- Part 1: From our operational databases to parquet files in S3 \- Part 2: From parquet in S3 to Snowflake raw layer.Inside Snowflake, other pipelines to move from RAW to analytical-ready layer (under construction/consideration, but most likely will be dbt building dynamic tables) -> so a medallion architecture.The idea was to keep data movement as loosely coupled as possible. This was doable because we dont have low-latency requirements (daily jobs are more than enough for analytics)In my opinion, keeping the software developer mindset while designing architecture was the biggest leverage I had (modularity and loose coupling being the 2 main ones that came to mind).

nsncjte,"Love the topic! Here are my two cents *with a twist* on it. **Type of firm** FinOps - SW Procurement and IT Cost Management**Current project brief description** Building Data Platform for Client Expenditure Reports**Data size** \~2B records raw (source), \~1M aggregated (target)**Stack and architecture** PySpark, SQL, Azure (Databricks and SQL Database), GitHub**Brief explanation of the flow** 0. Multiple datasources (files, DBs, APIs) -> 1. DataFactory pipelines, transferring data to Databricks (Catalogs) -> 2. Writing custom transformations (Notebooks) -> 3. Packing them in separate Jobs and scheduling execution -> 4. Transferring data to Azure SQL DB. -> 5. Data used in (PowerBI) reports.**Two cents** I'm working in a small, but very capable team - initially we were a band of three, since recently only two persons, so we get occasional helping hand from SWE Tech Lead when load becomes too big. We don't have dedicated architect nor major restraints regarding stack, other than to have pipelines running inside Azure Databricks (medallion arch ofc). We started this project from scratch, having *all the freedom* regarding implementation. Currently we are in our 8th month, approximately two more to finish this phase (creating and migrating all reports from old to new platform). Biggest lesson learned - **DO NOT** get in love with your code! If project is constantly growing, take time and effort to make sure you **still** have scalable solution. Don't be afraid to completely overhaul your solution. We refactored our complete codebase 2 times already. First time right after our very first successful production run (4 month into the project). It wasn't good for the moral because we put great effort to come up with working solution at that time, but we knew we had to re-do almost everything if we were going to add more things in near future. Felt low-on-fuel, but overall happy with what we had. Second one came just a month after all that, in order to accommodate some intra-company changes... Didn't sit right with us, especially because we were short-staffed at that moment, but went for it. And it's the best thing we could have done! Now we have highly reusable code, flexible to implement any new request and not worry of breaking any existing feature. And finally, the **Twist** If you want to learn more (quickly) about DA, kickstart some personal project! Try to solve something that's dear to you. Leverage available vibe/ai-tools if you want to come up with full-stack solution, trust me it's worth the effort! I've dived into two personal projects since summer (one NBA fantasy related, other for organizing my pick-up basketball group) and I couldn't be happier to see them up and running, and even used by some complete strangers! That way I branched out (and returned) to some other tools, services and methodologies (Airflow, Postgres, Supabase, CORS etc.) which I probably won't touch in my current company. I feel like I've expanded my horizons in more ways and topics from this experience than with any other work/company related one. You get to wear multiple technical hats, call all the shots and learn from your (and only your) mistakes.Anyhow, whichever learning path you decide to take, make sure to \*enjoy the process! \^\^ ^(\*but don't fall in love with your code/solution :D)",k3mwer,2025-12-06 20:19:56,4,dataengineering,t3_1pf01fh,False,

My main current focus for improvement is observability as it's no where near the way I want it. Then after that improving the analysts data modelling ability and tidying up the DBT sprawl. I'm pretty proud of achieving all this within 2 years as when I arrived there were just two dozen silo'd R scripts on an EC2 cron job working only on production web data on top of postgres.

nsqc820,"Few thoughts\- How good an option moving home is depends on where you are from, what the economics are. If you're in the UAE and you feel trapped, makes me wonder if you're from a developing country where UAE is offering a good alternative.\- People with jobs are almost always more attractive to employers than people without. Is there a reason searching for new jobs while staying in your current job is not an option? Could you search for different jobs in UAE or at home whilst still in your current one?\- 5 hour commute is absolutely insane. Doing anything you can, even accepting worse housing options or conditions, or paying more for housing, may be worth getting back that time. Even if you had one hour back from commute, that's 1 hour you could develop your skills, or meditate and try and separate yourself from the stress of work, or search for jobs, or just relax. Giving you more personal time will multiply your effectiveness both at work, at self improvement, and at pushing your career.\- freelance or remote work seems extremely difficult and competitive. It will probably need you to be good at optimising your offerings to clients, being a good salesman, good at negotiating more work,, etc etc. If you are struggling with stakeholder management at your UAE job, this may not be the way.\- Real life experience >>>> bootcamps and self driven projects, unless you are very good at learning real life 2skills from self driven projects (past positive achievements in this would be a green flag).\- Again back to the jobs thing, bootcamps, freelance, etc puts you in the desparate masses of unemployed tech. Having an actual, real data job elevates you above everyone else in the bottom of the barrel. Don't take your foot out of the door unless you are ok with it closing, or you have another door open elsewhere.\- For your UAE job, you have to step back from your tech focus and focus on people skills, expectations management, and building alliances.1. Find smart, driven people in the org who understand you and are receptive to the problems. Recruit them as allies. Find out what they need and support them. Example from my work. Normally, cybersecurity and data have an adversarial relationship. Data wants to move data and make it accessible, cyber wants to say no, to wrap everything in paperwork. But by meeting with the cybersecurity guy, saying noone in my dept cares about cybersecurity, wants to make it happen, I want to do it, help me, we become friends. I speak up for cybersecurity in my department, he is careful with how he rolls out cybersecurity (he avoids saying ""no"" reflexively because he knows I can be trusted, and he needs to balance security vs useablity), he speaks up for my data needs as a precondition for effective security in meetings, etc.2. Your job sounds like a consultant job. Consultants have the problem all the time of being parachuted into crazy broken situations with clients who want everything fixed, but don't have much money and are defensive about change (dogwithfrisbeeinmouthmeme.jpg - only fix, no diagnose or make us look bad!). This is a huge industry so learn from consultants about how to come in, get the client on your side, help talk them around to fixes without making them look bad, change management, etc etc. Youtube, books etc might be a help here.3.

Fuzzy matching, probabilistic matching, joining on multiple identity columns/definitions, blah blah blah - if you've soaked up some of those kinds of problems in a reconciliations environment, you'll be surprised how often they come up in different situations.As you mention, a lot of those ""garage-clearance"" problems are at the root of what stands in the way of success in any large organisation - this is the type of work that an Enterprise or Data Architect would seek to address/solve - so if you've got the stomach for trying to fix those kinds of very real problems, that might be an angle to look into - entry might be through a Solutions Architect route, where you get to design specific systems targeted at solving specific problem areas - that was my ""in"", and I found it presented a nice wide range of things to work on, while keeping a reasonable focus project per project.

A production pipeline should never fail silently. If the issue is more on the SLA side you can use an observability tool external to Airflow that supports SLAs or a control Dag that flags if a Dag that should have run did not.

nslb56t,"Hmm, tricky. So you're computing over long baseline rolling windows, and you're wrestling with the fact that- old records can receive long-delayed updates- that could meaningfully change your past computed values- bringing those values closer to 'the truth'- but the source system has no recorded update timestamp that you could use to decide which data to include in the batch, only a unique ID for each record?(Before I suggest something, let me just note that there's a solution space that involves talking to whomever it is that controls the upstream and persuading them about the merits of SCD fields. But assuming that's not an option:)How about this:- you have to load _all_ data into GCS every day because of the lack of update timestamps- use GCS lifecycle rules to quickly move old data into archival storage: you're not going to need it unless you need to run the entire process from the top- in your warehouse, create staging tables:1. CDC table, which persists (more on this below)2. today's batch, overwritten entirely every day, simple upload from GCS3. change table, created every day by comparing (1) with (2) to find rows that have changed (for example, using `EXCEPT DISTINCT` if supported by your warehouse)Now, the idea is to update the CDC table using the change table. It should have a couple of extra columns vs the source: `valid_from` and `valid_until`. You filter on `valid_until IS null` when constructing the change table, to get the latest version of each record. Otherwise, you ignore these columns when constructing the change table.If a row with a certain ID appears in the change table, you first need to update its latest record in the CDC table, such that `valid_until` is changed from `null` to yesterday's date. That record now tells you that the row changed in today's batch; it had those values yesterday, but not today.Finally, you insert the new version of the row (from the change table) into the CDC table, setting `valid_from` to today's date and `valid_until` to `null`: this is now the current version of the row.I think this gets you where you need to be:- the CDC table is a persistent record of all changes- it can be rebuilt from scratch in an emergency, by iterating the above process over the old data batches in GCS archival storage- you can `SELECT * FROM cdc_table WHERE valid_until IS null` to build the current version of the data; you can then compute your rolling window over _that_ table",PaddyAlton,2025-12-06 13:38:18,35,dataengineering,t3_1pfna3x,False,

Uses the fact that storage is cheap and keeps the ingestion simple and straightforward.During ingestion, add an extracted_at timestamp column. Afterwards as a post-processing step, dedup by keeping the record with the most recent extracted_at timestamp per unique key (using row_number() over the composite key partition for example). Index/cluster on the timestamp and composite unique key for performance.If recording the exact changes (SCD2) is not part of the current requirement, I think this approach keeps the ingestion simple, produces less logic to maintain, and is flexible enough to allow for a more complex logic in the future when the need arises (you can recompute/backfill as you have all of the raw data).You always keep the most recent version of each unique entitiy in your table, thereby having an exact copy of source. This approach also handles deletes in source.Lastly the real solution here is collaboration with the upstream owners of the data.

But there's no sharding so enjoy the distributed shuffles (or maybe not, see below).Even after this realization they don't provision enough of it; the largest storage tier is 16TB. Even if we double that to guess the maximum, that's at least an order of magnitude smaller than a typical medium or large-scale warehouse. For example the last cluster I worked on had 450TB of SSD.It's also horrible in other ways such as requiring a full table refresh from a source table instead of updates, so the interactive data lags. There's no way to load an interactive table directly, so customers pay twice, once for a source table and once for the interactive one.They warn that warming the cache could take an hour -- that's a clue that they're using storage-intensive instance types; most i series have about that SSD-to-network bandwidth ratio.

ntjzij0,"Data Vault is still very much relevant, and it has nothing to do with storage formats, compute engines, or any specific technology It’s simply a way to organize data when things change a lot, more like design pattern. It’s not meant to solve every problem, but if a company constantly brings in new data sources or its existing schemas change several times a year, and it still needs clean, consistent data to work with, Data Vault fits that situation very well.Recently I was Data Architecting in a project, where Data Vault was the solution to the client’s issues. A mid-sized company running an HR platform had thousands of clients but a small internal team, so they relied on many external tools: onboarding, contracts, bookkeeping, payments, their main app, and several new systems planned for the next year. Each tool had its own user table (some even had several users tables), and none of them matched. If you ran count(*) on each system’s user table, you got different numbers every time. Each system stored different pieces of information. Analysts didn’t know which database had the data they needed. Even when they found the right one, joining across systems caused rows to disappear, so they couldn’t trust anything.Data Vault solved this cleanly. We created a single Hub_User table that lists every user across all systems. For each subsystem, we added a satellite tables that hold the columns coming from each system. Everything is connected using the same hash key, so joins always work the same way. Analysts now start from Hub_User, and they know exactly where each system’s data lives. Nothing gets lost during joins. When the company adds another tool next year, the team will only need to add one more satellite, and none of the existing reports will break.This kind of constant change is normal in real data environments, and DV is a design pattern for that. I would say that it’s definitely not for newbies and requires discipline. But it’s true for all design patterns :)",lieber_augustin,2025-12-11 23:43:18,3,dataengineering,t3_1pk3l0u,False,

nt5sqc3,"The reason to study C is not because the language itself is interesting, or because it's especially useful for real-world programming.The reason is that C is such a simple and low-level language that it allows you to ""see"" the guts of how things actually work, instead of having them hidden from you.For instance, when you start using Java you'll immediately encounter the object-oriented programming style. You'll see things like objects, classes, methods, inheritance, etc. And from the perspective of a Java programmer, all that stuff just works ""by magic"", because the Java compiler and the JVM implement everything for you. Whereas if you think about how to implement the same thing in C, you'll be peeling back the layers of abstraction and you'll be forced to learn more about what's actually happening under the hood.The same thing applies to data structures. In Java, you can just declare an `ArrayList` that automatically resizes itself to fit the data it contains. C doesn't contain such a resizable array type, but you can implement it yourself using the lower-level primitives such as `malloc` and `realloc`. And doing that work yourself forces you to really understand what's going on. Writing something like that in C is a way to force yourself not to ""cheat"" by taking advantage of existing higher-level constructs.Even if you never plan to *use* C for any real projects, I personally believe that understanding low-level programming will help make you a better developer in the long run. (For one thing, it helps you get a better understanding of performance. In higher-level languages, the speed of a given piece of code depends largely on the behavior of many layers of abstraction that are being hidden from you. In C, what you write is much closer to what the CPU actually executes.)But having said that: as a student, I don't think you should prioritize learning C over the actual courses that you're being graded on.

You could make the computer do anything you could think of.I loved games and fancied myself a future game programmer.I didn't take any classes (there weren't really any back then, where I was from)I didn't LEARN programming, like sitting in front of a machine doing lessons. I wanted to try something, tried to research what I needed to do to accomplish it, and tried it out.I made many, many things along the way and most of the time, it was, ""for fun"".As an example, in the early 2000's the MMORPG Ragnarok became popular around the world (and in south east asia). I came across some code that could extract and view the 3D models of maps and buildings in the Ragnarok data file and decided I wanted to make a program that would let you look around the map as you wanted using WASD controls.Thus RagCam was born, and it was shared in some communities.I was also able to find some code to import 3D models into the then popular 3D software 3D Studio max. I also made a system tray Desktop Toy that let you ""Store Files"" in the ""Kafra Storage"" A Kafra is a NPC in the game that you interact with to store stuff, and I made a program that pops up the image of the anime-style girl in a kid of maid outfit where you can store notes and files.When I got into pirating (ahem, ""streaming"") TV shows I wanted to get notified if there was a new episode, so I made a local site that checked for updates. I also made a scraper that downloaded (english) subtitles based on the file name.I try to make programs that intersect or tanget my interests, which include anime, games, emulation of retro consoles, and more recently AI generated images.It's really up to you to define what programming means to you,I'm an old soul, and for me programming is more than just a way to earn money or the latest technology and cool frameworks.It's an interface between me and my inner self. A way to self-express through technology.Make programming fun. It's all about you.In the corporate world, I did some fun stuff.

Then capitalize the first letter ever. What are separators? space, comma, priod, exclamation, question.

EDIT: So when I see this problem, there needs to be a way to COUNT the occurance of each letter in the word. ~~So the simplest way is~~ The way I would approach this, is have 26 buckets, one for each letter. (use an array for implementation)Loop through the word, add one to bucket as you come across the matching letter. ADD: Then we go through the whole list... If any bucket shows >1, it's not an isogram. ADD: But can we go even faster? Do we need to check the whole word? No, we can say ""not isogram"" when we discover the FIRST repeated character. We don't need to got through the whole word. ADD: So we loop through the word, +1 to bucket of matching letter. But before you add 1, check if the bucket is 1 or 0. If it's 1, this is a repeat letter, then you exit the loop and answer ""not isogram"".

ntg7tky,"## ExpositionI'm a lot like you in the sense that I want to understand the ""full stack"" of every system I run across. For years it has got me glued to books on computer science and on general programming topics, chatting with AI about the subject, googling, watching YT videos, etc. It has helped me gain a good basis for how things work but it has also been a way for me to avoid the really hard job of coding itself.## The ProblemWithout getting too much into meditation and casual research I've done on psychology, the basic problem is this: It's not the subject matter - programming or computer science - *it's the response to that internal state while learning the subject matter*. You need ways to switch off that self-referential egotalk. It won't go away before you start treating it and other internal feelings and thoughts as ""information"" rather than realities that are playing out or describing ""who you are"". They are chemical events, some helpful, some unhelpful. The system that spawns them is full of messy, contradictory responses to these internal events that don't always make sense. Your brain has neuroplasticity, and whether you like it or not even your identity is a construction. Yes, we all have some properties like IQ and EQ that determine some speed or efficiency of function but again those don't determine binary outcomes. The real hindrance is the ego butting in when the analytical parts are trying to do their job or those parts tiring out.I've wired my brain to be lazy, inattentive and identify myself as stupid. The identity itself and the thoughts surrounding it is a learned set of patterns. That wiring can change, the feelings it produces while under stress can change and my image of myself can change but they won't unless I keep allowing my brain to default to those pathways and don't offer it new experiences and responses to certain difficult stimuli.## The Realities of the FieldThe feeling of not knowing something or being confused will never change in this field. Your conscious response to that can and that will ultimately lead to your brain interpreting those signals differently. You'll even start to love the challenge of not knowing, if you can get out of your own way.## What to focus on - the narrow approach**Your real goal is learning to understand systems, syntax and data.** There are easier and harder approaches to this but generally I'd say **try to learn how memory works**. And learn it robustly. Study the virtual memory system, study file systems, study how different information - audio, text, graphics, device state - get modeled in memory. While there are millions of libraries, protocols and file formats, they have to all converge on the simple core truth of writing bytes to or reading bytes from memory. If you can nail this layer, write a few parsers that interpret file formats or networking protocols, you'll get a solid grasp of the simple fact that **software is just agreed upon patterns of bytes**. This won't trivialize learning libraries but it will trivialize a certain notion of ""newness"" from them - they aren't anything new. They may sit at several levels lower or higher on the software stack but they are all still just memory. ## On AI Resources are sometimes hard to come by but AI is actually pretty good for this. As long as you aren't copying code but rather asking questions on subjects that are stable and unlikely to change - how things in computer science, and the technologies that express it, work - you can get very good, very detailed answers. Plus you can go back and forth with it, trying to nail and refine your understanding. It's like taking notes with a tutor.## ConclusionSo don't be like me. Don't rush. Accept discomfort. Accept being stupid and having to ask. Think of the skill acquisition portion like laying bricks on a giant wall. You wish for a fast and glorious end result, you'll even settle for ""100 more bricks laid out today, look at that progress!"" but what you need and what you get by showing up and working every day is that one brick.

ntgsvdm,"I teach high school computer science, but I do not come from working in industry, so I've been one who has been building my CS skills over the last decade after being asked to take on teaching CS. Previously I taught mostly pre-engineering STEM stuff at the middle school level.I have been taking a lot of CS classes from one of the state universities here thanks to a grant funded program paying for the tuition and fees. Nothing like getting a lot of credit hours at no financial cost! But those classes absolutely have kicked my tail, often leaving me feeling that ""not smart enough"" feeling you mention. I did OK with Python because I had some previous experience with it, but the Java classes were tough. But I definitely learned new things! Now I'm in my last class for this certificate, Data Structures and Algorithms. I am certainly experiencing many moments of being baffled. But I keep grinding and slowly things get clearer.For me, the purpose of doing this is to pump up my general knowledge and skills so I can better help my students and hopefully have fewer ""I dunno"" moments when they ask me something.I think one thing we forget about learning in general is that part of the point of grinding through the work isn't the specific content or items being learned, but instead it's just the flexing of our mental muscles, helping our synapses get better at seeing and making connections and patterns out of what we interact with.",WheatedMash,2025-12-11 13:55:29,1,learnprogramming,t3_1pjp3p0,False,

nsrutj5,"As a student, it’s totally acceptable not to know which specific niche of the industry you want to end up in. The advice that served me well when I started 20-ish years ago (I’m 40 now) was this: early in career, build broad base general skills and allow your curiosity to drive casual exploration of niche disciplines -> later in career build specialized skills in what you’re most interested in and what you can get a job in, both. The way I did this: 1. Python and C were my broad base languages. I learned them well and chose them because they’re used everywhere. Early on, I focused on design patterns and learning the abstract algebra and category theory that explains why those design patterns work. I also focused on getting really good at C and Python intending to keep them as my core language. 2. From there in 2013 I noticed functional programming was gaining traction, so I decided to learn Haskell. After that I got put on a project at my company that required Scala and I excelled at it because knowing Python, C, and Haskell gave me an edge over other engineers who didn’t have all three (especially Haskell). That set me apart and enabled me to get good at Akka, Spark, and later Cats Effect, which propelled me into Big Data. Also given the landscape at this time I was forced to learn Java :man_shrugging_light_skin_tone:, I didn’t care for it and more or less endured it. 3. At this point as a mid level engineer I’d now gotten exposure to low-level and embedded C, desktop development, server development and database programming, web development, streaming development, microservices, data science, big data engineering involving batch and mini batch processing and data ingestion, machine learning, AI, procedural OOP, and functional programming through Haskell and Scala.4. I discovered I liked the problems and wild-west style complexity of big data environments so I chose to specialize in that. That prompted me to focus on Scala FP for streaming (Cats Effect, Akka) and Spark (batch and mini batch), Python (PySpark, Pandas, Scikitlearn, Airflow, etc), and Go (Kubernetes and other distributed system type stuff). In 2025 it’s still doing really well for me. I was able to learn all of this stuff by taking about an hour a day 4-ish days a week plus 2-4 hours on Saturday a couple times a month in the first 5-10 years of my career to work on personal exploration type of stuff and choosing to stay focused on one thing long enough to really know it (when I got curious about something, I would add it to a list I kept for that to give me the feeling that I would get to it even though I knew I wouldn’t - but I did pick from that list when I finished something and wanted to pick up something new).",owp4dd1w5a0a,2025-12-07 15:27:48,2,learnprogramming,t3_1pgatf9,False,

Exposure to more theoretically profound languages will backfire a bit when you go back to some, let's say, primitive languages.

If you're going solo, you're having to discover everything on your own.Introductory programming materials are just that - introductory. They're teaching you grammar and syntax - enough to be dangerous, but it's only just the start. These tutorials and materials NEVER teach you how to USE the language, and they can't. There's so much nuance and detail and intuition that it can't be captured - you can't just be told.So yeah, this is the time they call ""tutorial hell"", where you learn the hard way that there ARE NO tutorials that carry you to where you want to go. You burn yourself out on that before you accept your fate, and it's hard work from here.And I hope you're over this hump already, but learning C++ won't teach you how to make a game. You need linear algebra, calculus, and physics. You need to learn concepts like collision, frustums and culling, the light equation, model hierarchies, graph theory, inverse kinematics, audio, input, networking, shaders, normal mapping, texture mapping, gameplay, then you've got design, you'll probably want some embedded scripting like Lua, you'll need to support assets and their file formats...It's best if you pick up the maths, because you can't avoid that one, and that you then use an engine that implements all the bits you're not interested in doing yourself.

nsx103x,"Tldr: I dont understand your question or what your friend is saying... because data structures and algorithms are used in literally every programming language... below is a rant clarifying what I believe is what info you're missing. At the end of the day it doesn't matterIm assuming by DSA you are referring to Data Structures and algorithms right?Those are used in every single programming language, the only difference you may be hearing about is that some languages differences and not actually related to anything about data structures or algorithms... No shade meant by this, but that is something I think someone with an AI/ML background would be familiar with so I am going to assume it's not necessarily an AI background in the sense that you an ML engineer, and possibly what you mean is more that you use AI. I only say that to preface that I'll try and explain what I mean about languages, not to cast aspersions.Anyway, what you may be hearing i suspect, especially because of the recommended languages you've received, is more related to low and high level programming languages. You know all code eventually becomes machine language, ones and zeros is the name of the game, but we dont type out ones and zeros, we use words that them selves get converted to something, then something else, then something else, then eventually something a machine can understand. In coding terms these are layers of abstractions, something ""represents"" something else, and the magic is often that you can hide complexity by having thing X not only translated to thing Y, but also do Z as well to make the statement more concise. Low level languages (like C++) are ones that you work closer to the hardware, meaning there are fewer abstractions away from giving a computer 1s and 0s. This can be a very good thing, abstractions require effort, and that means you can write code that uses less effort on the machines end and make things go fast and use less memory. However, abstractions are done for a reason, and the flip side of a low level language is that you will write a lot more code to do the same thing that another language may be able to do in a fraction of the amount of lines of code, a big pain point being you end up handling memory yourself at this level. High level languages on the other hand are abstracted a more layers up and hide the scary bits like memory management from the developer by handling it themselves, and tend to be much closer to readable human language as a result. Python and Java are both high level languages, but keep in mind that doesnt make them better or worse, just different. So why isnt everything done with a high level language if they can take away all the annoying things that exist in programming? With abstractions come trade offs, the more that your code does ""for you"" the less control you have. You dont have to do annoying memory management and consider a lot of stuff when programming in a language like Python like when its OK for your app to ""forget"" something to free up memory. In languages at this level a feature that is built in handles it for you by occasionally checking the app, and deleting unused memory and freeing it up for later, its called a garbage collector, and this does not exist at the low level, and not having it can be a pain in the ass. But what happens if garbage day is on Monday, and you forget to bring out your trash and today is Tuesday...? You are stuck with the garbage until the garbage man comes around next week, in high level languages this happens to because its not a constant process and works kind of in cycles. Low Level languages can create memory, use it, and the second its no longer needed free it up for something else to use that memory. This allows more efficiency in your code, but requires more dev work, and opens up Pandora box and can lead to an exponentially amount of new bugs or issues. If I wrote 2 programs in Python and C++ tonight, I could do it. But I promise you that my Python will without question be faster than my C++ code. Is Python ""faster"" than C++? Nope, I just am a novice at C++, I know enough to be dangerous, but beyond that 9 times out of 10 my Python is faster due to my own lack of experience with it. And if you told me to create an app in 10 hours or I will die, Ill choose Python every time because the high level abstractions lead to increased developer speed. NOT better app, NOT faster code, less of my time as a developer being used (which in theory could be used to make more code for some other project or learn something new)As far as data structures and algorithms are concerned, they are not language specific, it makes no sense to frame it that way imo. Data structures are ways to organize data. Algorithms are sequences to process data. The programming languages are like syntax in verbal languages, DSA is kinda like forming complex sentences. So there's no correct answer to your question, because it doesnt really make sense. I suppose if you goal is to learn data structures and algorithms at a granular level and really understand how the computer really handles them, a low level language will force you to really get down to that level and put the work in to learn that stuff. If your goal is to apply data structures and algorithms more than learn the granular details, a high level language is the choice. Honestly even that dichotomy isn't a super great way to put it, its just the closest way I could think to answer your question in a way that gives you something to consider. Another way to put that is that learning DSA concepts in a lower level language will expose you more closely to how a computer really uses data structures and algorithms, giving you a better baseline. However, a high level language will allow you to learn these concepts faster and more efficiently. There's no avoiding learning them, and neither path is correct. That being said... if you truly ""know"" python... to be honest you should already be familiar with a lot of data structures and algorithms, so my recommendation would be to stick with Python and fill up those holes in your skill set without having to learn these concepts and a whole new language at the same time slowing the process.

Specifically the Exception handling and the huge risk of null-pointer exceptions everywhere.And it doesn't get any better that Java was never truly intended to run interactive text-terminal applications, but for some crazy reason almost every school thinks that their students should be forced to struggle with System.out, System.in, Exceptions and the Scanner - which is intended for ""scanning"" through text-files (hence the name) and not for receiving badly formatted input from the user ...

nte3yqh,"That's a lot more readable, nice.In `validate_operator` the only exception that can occur is when `self.expression` is an empty string in which case `self.expression[-1]` will fail. You can just change the if statement to check this instead: `if self.expression and self.expression[-1] in self.operators and input in self.operators:` since `bool(self.expression)` will be false, when the string is empty.In the case of `calculate`, the main two errors are `SyntaxError` (raised, for example when you try `eval("""")`) or `ZeroDivisionError`. Depending on what input is possible, `NameError` is possible (`eval(""x + 1"")`). Thinking about what errors can occur forces you to think about why they happen and how to handle them. You should definitely handle the SyntaxError and ZeroDivisionError in some way. If you really want, you can catch those 2 with corresponding error messages and then catch all remaining exceptions (but I'd not catch them and let the calculator crash if something really completely unexpected happens instead of ignoring it. This would be a bug requiring a fix and not an expected exception like the other two).Alternatively, you should have a look at [the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval) about eval. You might want to either sanitize the input before evaluating the expression or write your own evaluation function, as eval is risky to use.

If you like reading, I would highly suggest familiarizing yourself with Clean Architecture and Domain Driven Design first before delving into derivatives like Microservices, Vertical Slices or even Moduliths.

Martin, Martin Fowler and Eric Evans.If not, set your own standards for how you want to name classes for specific patterns (i.e.: Builders, Repositories, Controller, Services, etc.) and then decide a folder structure (like most layered: Application, Domain and infrastructure) and rules for which classes may be defined in which folder structure.Your goal should be to make your code more resilient to the ""big ball of mud"", essentially trying to keep it ""easy to change"".

nsh845e,"Okay, lets see if I can explain this.First of all, Software Architecture is a planned design philosophy. Its how you organize your written code and decide on common styles so to compromise on writing ""same"" code across time as well as people. This is incredibly valuable, since you will recognize old or foreign code much easier, saving time on debugging, additions, modifications, etc. If Coding Guidelines define how you write code within a method, then Architecture is everything beyond that: Methods, Classes, Dependencies of Classes, Modules and Projects. However, its distinct from System Architecture, because it really doesnt ""care"" how which system or component is talking or integrating with another outside of code.From what I understand, project codebase organization is less a ""how do you code"" but more of a ""where are the files"". Software Architecture doesnt care if you use Github or TortoiseSVN nor does it care which IDE you use (on a high level, this actually isnt quite true).MVC is Microsofts take on a 3 Layered architecture (Model View Controller), MVT presumably is djangos version of the same thing, then there is the Onion/Clean Architecture that separate layers into Domain, Application and Infrastructure, sometimes even adding Contract and Presentation...The goal with all these is the same thing. Each layer is given an access hierarchy as well as a specific type of issue to address. This is an overhead and sometimes cumbersome but it ensures that you deal with specific problems in appropriate places and dont risk needing to rewrite your whole application just because your database got an update.MVC's approach decided to disregard making your application incredibly dependent on the used technologies, meanwhile Clean Architecture is the very opposite of that. Its why their structures are different. Some other Architectures like Moduliths or Microservices try to accommodate scalability in their approach, allowing your code to be designed to be spread across multiple servers from the ground up.

And it will teache you a lot. Since you’re not a fan of front-end and you’re studying applied maths + CS, you can lean into areas that have long-term demand:**1. Strengthen one backend language deeply:** You could pick **Kotlin / Java, Go, or Python** depending on the direction you want**.****2. Learn devops fundamentals:** You already touched deployment and Cloudflare, so the next step is:* Docker* CI/CD* Linux fundamentals* Nginx* Basic cloud (AWS, GCP, or Azure)Even basic competency in these instantly increases employability.**3. Databases + caching:** Most backend devs don’t go deep enough here. Understanding things like:* PostgreSQL indexing* Query optimization* Redis caching patterns* Background job queues**4. System design basics:** You don’t need FAANG-level system design, but knowing how APIs, queues, caching, and services fit together puts you on a different level.**5. Keep building small production projects:** Your CRM project is already strong. If you build 1–2 more **small, useful, real-world tools**, your portfolio becomes unbeatable, especially when paired with your degree.If you do these over the next 1–2 years, you’re basically shaping yourself into a backend engineer with DevOps literacy, which is one of the safest positions in the market right now.",tocka_codes,2025-12-10 12:23:31,1,learnprogramming,t3_1piyy8e,False,

Do you have a cool unique idea that you need to get in front of investors NOW before someone else does it? Well... maybe your prototype and your ""production ready"" app are very similar.. you'll have pissed off users running into bugs, but maybe you cross the finish line and get funding to refactor later (you wont, you will build on top of your garbage with more ""temporary"" garbage)Or maybe your code is handling how much radiation to blast a cancer patient with... Google Therac-25, one of the most famous software bugs dealing with exactly that.. If you are making something similar now, you better that testing, failsafes and a few more ""just in case are you sure this is the correct power to fire the laser"" screens in the final app are mandatory before release. Documentation even is considered a mandatory part of the ""code base"" in some projects Ive worked on, app works great without it, but future development is always an option. I know Rust teams that build out stuff quick and fast in Python and don't care about any bugs til they have something working, then they scrap their idea and treat it as nothing more than a proof of concept (suppose you could call it a prototype), and then rebuild it in Rust. They do this to get a proof of concept out ASAP and prove its worth pursuing in Python due to how fast you can do that compared to the much more cumbersome (but faster and safer) Rust. And on the flip side of all this.... you have companies that have 0 unit tests, use a custom build script that no one can read or understand because Bob who wrote the script in a 36 hour code binge one day used his own custom language he developed in high school that uses Tolkien characters as aliases to traditional syntax, and they fired him in 2008 when the market crashed but somehow the company survived and they have an app that they have considered production ready even before Bob showed up... Users somehow are shocked through their keyboard every 3rd time they log into this app and hate it, but they keep using it so the company marches on and pretends everything is great hoping, and management will fire you if it breaks while you're there, and will doxx users if they leave a 1 star review.Tldr; its a bunch of things, nothing specific. Hopefully the standards you set have testing, SPECIFIC mandatory features that need to exist first before new stuff is added, documentation, and have set things up in a way that it isn't a nightmare to maintain a year from now or when new coders show up. Thats another reason docs are important to move on from ""prototype"", being consistent with a style guide and practices you use, even if they arent what the language specifies. If you write Python and decide to use CamelCase, thats gross... but if the team style guide says so, and your code is consistent, you use it even if it's ""wrong"". And new devs joining the team will be able to follow the style guide and be productive without issue. Apps, like companies, grow and being ready for more users isnt the only important thing, you should be ready to add new devs and set them up to be productive and keep things consistent ideally. Wrote a lot and maybe seems like my comment is all over the place, but honestly thats kinda how it works.

It used to be the general idea that an interface was a **contract** \- which you'll see repeated in a lot of other comments here - but gradually it has changed a bit to also allow interfaces to be ""*sort-of composition-components""* that you can add to your class to get some additional functionality.

My first few years covered computer architecture, databases, python and Java, data structures, and object oriented design (and design patterns in general)I started learning web dev with the basics, Javascript/css/html. After a couple months, I started learning frontend frameworks starting with Vue (easy-ish to pickup imo) and eventually moving to React because it is more widely adopted in the industry.Then I went deeper into backend and ops. Setting up auth, logging, APIs, and deploying the application. This part was absolutely the most difficult for me and I had a written step by step guide walking me through the process of setting up VMs on Digital Ocean and AWS where I'd have to ssh in and setup hosting and start the application. This process would have to be repeated (condensed a bit) whenever the backend application was updated. Nowadays, it is much easier to host fullstack applications but this is still good to know as a professional.Anyway, all of that was another 2yrs of grinding and I did a webdev bootcamp around the end 2020. I got my first job in 2021 (July/August).

That said, you may run into some hiccups if you're not too familiar with Latin>Latin has a very interesting way of generating words: You have an word stem, which usually doesnt change, and then an very big number of possible suffixes that change based on the context in which the word appears.This is arguably not all that interesting on its own; well over 50% of the languages on earth have inflection on nouns. That said, that's a minor gripe. Another minor gripe:>And nouns are a comparatively easy example here. Putting aside the fact that the suffixes also change based on the declension of a word (mostly affected by grammatical gender), Verbs have even more different attributes to them, especially when it comes to the tempus.Case, Class, Gender, and Plurality are all involved in declension. Declension is the act of changing the inflection (grammatical affixes) of a noun. In talking about the different suffixes nouns have based on case, we are inherently talking about declension - not putting it aside.> I am currently trying to learn Latin by inserting the rules of the language into a Java library.Don't know how effective that'll be for learning the language, but as a programming project, it's neat!>In the nominative case, its just ""Servus"", while the genitive case has ""servi"", the dative has ""servo"" and the accusative case has ""servum"" (Cases determine the function of a Noun in the context of a sentence and therefore are extremly important for translations). But then there are also the plural forms, which are ""Servi"", ""servorum"",""servis"" and ""servos"" respectively.If you intended to store things as stems, you might run into issues as there are 5 basic noun classes in Latin ignoring irregulars. ""Servus"" may be class II, but ""Puella"" is class I, and thus declines differently. In order to determine which class a word uses, you need both the nominative, and the genitive forms of the word - you can't always derive all forms from the one stem alone.As for how you could handle this, there's a few options.Least structurally intensive is just feeding the noun constructor an enum of the noun class, followed by the stem, and just switch-casing how the noun declines the stem based on that. Alternatively, make an abstract noun class, and create subclasses of it that each handle a different type of noun.The problem with the above is that it couples your conjugations to the noun classes/subclasses, which isn't very SOLID - bad practice. Preferred option would be to ditch the enums, and create a number of Declension Strategies (See: [The Strategy Design Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy)) you can feed the constructor. This has the benefit of decoupling your declensions from the nouns themselves.Regardless of which of the above do the job, if you want to restrict which nouns get which declension without putting that logic in the noun class itself (again, best practice), you could also implement a Noun Factory or Builder (See: [The Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method) or [Builder](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder)) which can take in the nominative / genitive forms of a noun, determine its class, and create a noun object with the appropriate strategy for you.But that's a whole lot of over engineering, so take it all with a grain of salt.

You could also build deep domain expertise in a target industry, and then get hired to work at these companies anyway, and this will probably yield a better result because you won't just be doing micro optimizations for them if you go this route. You can still do this in your spare time, but I would strongly suggest you prioritize your economic welfare first rather than primarily chasing a technical ideal. You have to find a balance, it's okay to experiment and learn niche things in depth, but you want there to be an eventual payoff if possible. For example, learning Rust or Elixir is a good investment of your time, and you'll naturally develop a network to draw from if you want to start a company or join one, but something like Common Lisp has a low probability of a payoff even if it's more fun (yes, I'm bitter). I followed my interest and got a very good career out of it, but I've also seen what happens when people optimize purely for skill. As a developer in any mid to large sized company you'll basically never be given the discretion needed to fully utilize tools designed around peak individual productivity, but the money will dull the pain somewhat.You have to develop a certain pragmatism about how you do things. I still actively pursue things that most would consider to be impractical, but I balance that with extracting as much money as possible from our corporate overlords and deep pocketed VCs.",humanguise,2025-12-08 22:11:02,2,learnprogramming,t3_1phctkq,False,

nt4pib4,"> Is this something you're actually passionate about and wanting to learn? Or is this just to get a job?For me it's about the perfection of my craft. You can think of programming as artistic expression. I want beauty and elegance. I want to make the best software that I can.Along with that comes learning. Along with that comes a job, because the pursuit of my craft overlaps with people's need for software.The job is not the craft. Jobs don't pay you for beautiful, elegant solutions, they pay you for results. You have to figure out how to be a craftsman within the context of THEIR time and THEIR money to make what THEY want. You do get some push-back, though; if they hire you, they can tell you WHAT, but they are deferring to you for HOW. No one gets to tell me how to do my job, or they can do it themselves. As a junior, you get told HOW a lot, because there's still a lot of learning at the beginning of your career, but then you start developing an opinion, and eventually, it starts holding it's own. That's how you know you're ready to be a senior developer.> If you're only in this for money then you may struggle to find the motivation to continue progressing with your learning as jobs are not easy to get in this field.Who are you speaking for? Because I would say the majority of the industry would probably disagree with you. I have found very few craftsmen in my 30 years of pursuing software development. Most I've met have never given a damn, most I met literally say ""just get it done"", they say - and I've been told by them that they ""code for today"", as they see that as virtuous; that sounds to me like the goal is doing the least amount of work possible without getting fired, the least amount of work to gain status and pay, until they peak at diminishing returns. To them, their craft is corporate politics, and BOY HOWDY have I seen them master THAT.Jobs are surprisingly easy to get in this field. You don't even need a formal education.

But you don't need developers for that - almost anyone with a little bit of programming knowledge can vibe code their way through the easy stuff.It is when there are no off-the-shelf solutions, no tutorials to look up, the AI is striking out...that's when you need someone with skills. Someone with some mental fortitude to be able to work through complex problems, debug, and problem solve. Who can go looking through poorly written documentation or undocumented code. Who ultimately understands that, after a certain point, the buck stops with them - if they can't *find* a solution to the problem, they have to think through and *make* one.I think, like in an interview it is telling when a would-be developer get asked a question they've never seen before. They don't *know* the solution - but that's fine, because a lot of times you won't know the solution. So does the candidate sit down, start to think, formulate a plan, examine that plan, revise it and otherwise think through the problem until they get a solution? Or do they just shrug and give up and go ""I've never seen this problem before, so I can't solve it""?So, for instance, if a software developer wanted to know what the software developer mindset was, they wouldn't just post a question in a subreddit - they'd do some research. Find some books written by notable in the field and read them. Read some blog articles. Put together their own idea of what it means - and once they've put in the mental work of figuring it all out, then they might ask some others if they were on the right track.**tl;dr:** Being able to solve problems instead of just asking others/the web/AI for solutions.",PoMoAnachro,2025-12-10 17:17:18,1,learnprogramming,t3_1pj7r62,False,

There may be common code between colliders and renderers, and that might (or not) be candidates for composition (depending on how “common” that code is).

nt3suv0,"With composition the idea is not that it's easier to *write* — it's sometimes a bit more boilerplate in 1-2 places. But it *is* easier to read, and to refactor without accidentally breaking things.Having said that in your example, whether the implementation of the behavior is the same or not, composition will look similar: it will make heavy use of *interfaces*. Using Go as an example (a language that only has composition, not inheritance):```gotype Collideable interface { Collide()}type Renderable interface { Render()}type Entity interface { Collideable Renderable}type Octopus struct {...}func (self *Octopus) Collide() {...}func (self *Octopus) Render() {...}type Spaceship struct {...}func (self *Spaceship) Collide() {...}func (self *Spaceship) Render() {...}```In the example above, Collideable is an interface that describes ""anything that collides"". Interfaces are commonly described as contracts; they do not contain any implementation, but they describe that such-and-such object will have such-and-such methods.the ""Entity"" interface is defined as ""anything which both collides and renders"". In order to be considered an ""Entity"", a type would have to be both Collideable and Renderable.A type satisfies an interface by implementing all of its mandatory methods. In order to be Collideable, a type needs a method called Collide, that has the same arguments / return type as in the interface. If it does, we say the type *implements* the interface.In Go, once a type implements the necessary methods, it will automatically be recognized as implementing the matching interface(s). In the example code above, both Octopus and Spaceship implement all 3 interfaces. (In some other languages you need to do something like `class Foo implements Bar` to make the interface relation explicit).Now on to your question. Focusing on just the Collideable interface, there are 2 scenarios: Either we have a common implementation, or we don't. If we don't, then the `func ... Collide() {...}` blocks above will contain different code. If there *is* a common implementation, you can e.g. pull it out into an external function:```gofunc Collision() {...}func (self *Octopus) Collide() { Collision()}func (self *Spaceship) Collide() { Collision()}```Alternatively, you can use composition to create another Collideable object, and reuse it for the Octopus and Spaceship:```gotype Collider struct {...}func (self *Collider) Collide() {...}type Spaceship struct { collider Collider ...}func (self *Spaceship) Collide() { self.collider.Collide()}type Octopus struct { collider Collider ...}func (self *Octopus) Collide() { self.collider.Collide()}```As you can see, the above example has a bit more boilerplate, but we have successfully combined composition and interfaces to give both Octpus and Spaceship the same implementation of the Collide() method, by giving them both the same ""collider"" property internally. Both Spaceship and Octopus implement Collideable, and they do it using the same implenentation (from ""Collider"").(Note: In Go, interfaces cannot contain implementation, only a list of methods (and their type signatures). In some other languages, interfaces are also (optionally) allowed to contain default implementations of their methods. That would allow us to skip the whole ""Collider"" thing and just write the default implementation for Collide() on the interface directly. Having said that, this can be a bad idea.)",kilkil,2025-12-09 13:00:30,2,learnprogramming,t3_1phnlqp,False,
nt4lm8s,"I sometimes refactor code that uses inheritance into code that uses composition and sometimes I refactor code that uses composition into code that uses inheritance. If you think you've stumbled into a superior design that happens to use inheritance, you could consider going for it. If your discover that your design is wrong then you could refactor it into composition.If you're not sure what to do you could err on the side of composition as a best practice. But I think it's wrong to dogmatically apply it (or most best practices) in a universal fashion.If I wind up with several classes that all inherit from the top of the hierarchy in a default fashion and have almost all of the same methods just delegating to some member/field/property/attribute, and in particular if I'm conceptually referring to that class as a form of that delegated object class, it's a sign that I would probably better benefit from refactoring it to inheritance.So do Octopus and Spaceship have no explicit super class? Do you think their instances ARE entities? Do they delegate heavily to a private entity instance? You'll probably have an easier time if you model it using inheritance. That's the way I think about it. I also don't mind getting it wrong and refactoring later, assuming I don't make a total mess of the system and I don't have a bunch of external systems that are going to be coupled to this particular design decision.",azimux,2025-12-09 15:41:47,2,learnprogramming,t3_1phnlqp,False,
nth5xl2,"there are various ways to look at it. At design time, sure, you usually look at 'this is a thing' vs 'this has a thing'. But there may be more to it, and often, that is a grey line. A thing can have a collision (has a?) or a collision can be a thing too, that (has-a) participants . A spaceship is not a collision, but a spaceship is a 3d point cloud that may touch another 3d point cloud and require behavior to detect that. Or maybe a spaceship has-a associated geometry/cloud/volume? Sometimes its just mental gymnastics around how your team thinks about the idea being expressed and can go either way.But there are other considerations. Collision detection is often a constantly running subsection of a game and may need to be as efficient as possible, so having it on the side in something as compact as possible may be a requirement regardless of how you feel about is-a and has-a. An array-like container of small objects with something like (pointer, ID number, something) and geometric info (what volume does it occupy) that you can do a scene-wide check against may be necessary for performance reasons even if that means pulling the data out of the bigger objects in a bizarre (from an OOP perspective) way -- this kind of thing is why some games use parallel array type concepts when normally that would be anti-OOP.And it could be a poor example. collisions are often done in passes, like center of object distance (skip if far away) followed by bounding spheres (skip if not touching) followed by simplified but correct geometry checking. That would be done the same way for all your objects; it just happens that your octopus and spaceship have different detailed geometry in the final stage but you still do it the same way, different inputs to the same function (?) in other words.The main thing I am rambling about though is that design can be a grey area at times, and you just have to make the best choice you can based off how you plan to use the information, which can be its own headache for something like the geometry of an object in 3d since you use that in so many places in so many different ways. It clearly belongs to its associated entity, but at the same time you may need to access a lot of them iteratively without any baggage.",Independent_Art_6676,2025-12-11 15:08:06,1,learnprogramming,t3_1phnlqp,False,

This is where I always start after 30+ years of doing this :) Next, add the next small thing, probably the proper html scaffolding. Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.Make TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack. Fill in the rest of the REST/CRUD stuff.Now for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.Do this with every small project you work on.

nsokmb2,"It is a complex web of reasons and I am probably not the best person to explain it but here are some things off the top that may explain the phenomenon.I know people who have attempted startups in India. By far the biggest roadblock to their growth, according to them, is the small addressable market. Despite its huge population, India has a relatively small number of people with enough disposable income for startups to feed on. This means a startup has a limited domestic ramp up before they must try to find foreign markets.Second, India doesn’t have the volume of original IP including, but not limited to, university research. You cannot exploit ideas you don’t have to become a tech giant.Third, the policy atmosphere and capital markets in India don’t really compare to the best countries. So, many companies move elsewhere once their requirements cannot be met in India. InMobi, one of the largest mobile ad serving companies in Asia ($1B), was started in India but moved HQ to Singapore.Many companies were sold off by founders as they no longer wished to continue. Walmart bought Flipkart, an Amazon competitor, for $16B from founders who wanted to exit.There are several companies that started of great, became household names, but were then unable to keep their momentum. PayTM ($10B), at one time, was backed by SoftBank, Alibaba group and Berkshire Hathaway who all exited.Finally, while India produces a high volume of CS people, the quality is very uneven and many of the best choose to immigrate (to the US till recently but also elsewhere).

One of the largest mistakes of my career. I was promoted multiple times, got yearly 7% raises, and all that stuff so it wasn't clear that I was committing career suicide in the moment.I didn't know people working at actual tech companies to compare what was happening. 2 of my friends whet to get their Ph.D. in CS and the others I knew went to work at DOD jobs or equally shitty non-tech companies. It wasn't until I found various subreddits that I realized what was going on at actual tech companies and how different our experiences were over the years.I was even leading teams of 20 SWEs, have my name on patents, and responsible for all software aspects of the medical device. I was working with interdisciplinary teams and all that good stuff. The problem was I was learning learning one way to do things and that way was not how modern software was created. It was old school 90's style engineering company with managers that have been there since the 80's and 90s doing things that exact same way.It was top down management where they want engineers that just do what they were told and think minimally for themselves.. The company had a lot of lifers that got a job there as a new grad and just never left. If you were not a lifer then you were early in your career and was easy to take advantage of. There were very few middle career engineers with multiple jobs under there belt at the company.Once I saw the light I started telling every new grad hires on the down low that they should stay for a year or 2 and learn what they can. After that leave and get a job at another company that is more tech focused. This company would talk about how they are growing by hiring 90 new engineers in the last year, but they don't tell you they lost 80 engineers over the course of the year so it was a net gain of 10 engineers.Take charge of your own career and don't expect any company to manage it for you in a way that's best for you and not the company.",diablo1128,2025-12-08 21:52:10,28,cscareerquestions,t3_1pholi8,False,

nt1p301,"Depending on your school, things might be easy. There might be a specific track or set of classes you take (honors, AP, etc). Once you choose a college, choose a major, etc, there starts becoming a pretty wide range. People who are better students don't necessarily become better in the workforce, and people who were better students don't necessarily lead better lives. It's the same for everyone as they get older, not just CS grads. I have a cousin who is a lawyer and very successful. She's very friendly, outgoing, and good at her job. But she also says she got lucky and had a really great mentor at her first job. An old friend was a terrible student. He got a job partially by luck. A recruiter contacted him, he passed some new grad interviews (not tech), but they forget to check his transcripts. He did well enough in his interviews they took a chance on him once they saw his GPA. It worked out for him. And it's not like your first job sets things in stone. Plenty of people ""level up"" at different points in their career. A great support system is obviously awesome, but it won't always be available. And at a certain point, you're responsible for your own life and career. I've been solo a lot of my career. There are times I wish I had more mentoring. But I look at a company I used to work at. It fell apart after acquisition and leadership changes. People tended to scatter to one of three companies, all of which had people in leadership positions from the previous company. One the one hand, it's great you have a good working relationship. But it also felt weird, and there are times I wondered if people were scared or hesitant to try something new and expand their networks.

nt67pbt,"Sorry to hear it, this is a rough spot to be in. The biggest thing that’s going to hold you back is making it through resume screening, and without any internship or real production experience it’s going to be very hard. My biggest suggestion is to network at companies where a referral actually helps you get your foot in the door and pushes you through the automated resume system. This means FAANG+ and big tech are out the door, as a referral will hold very little weight, and even if a real person reviews it, lack of experience will likely be your down fall. Connect with as many people as you can at smaller companies - even if that’s <200 employees. It might not even be a software company. Many CS majors have a “FAANG/Big tech or bust” philosophy and see everything else as a failure. If that’s you, you must put your pride away and take any chance you can get. This is a stepping stone, not the final form of your career.The next thing is to get very good at interviewing, leetcode, and preparing for a specific companies interview. This much is obvious, but your hit rate for interviews will be low, so when you do get one, you need to maximize the opportunity.I’d also really inspect how meaningful your personal projects are. I was surprised at how much weight they pulled during my interviews/screening, and I was told by multiple interviewers it made a large impression - which also means I got grilled on them so they could verify it was real/I did it lol. If your projects are very generic, even if done well, they likely aren’t helping as much as you think. Pick something you’d really love to learn about or make - maybe hobby related - and flesh it out a ton. The more niche/specific, the more memorable. Document well, consistent pushes, make graphs of your data and put them in the repo, reference research papers that informed decisions, etc.Lastly, I’d genuinely consider if a masters is right for you. New grad applications are already hell on earth, but doing them with no internship will be a challenge and a half. A masters degree puts you back in “intern” status before you finish it, so if you put your all into the things above during intern apps, you would likely snag some. Once you’re back to new grad apps, you could have an internship(s), maybe some light research experience (even if no paper), TA positions, and a higher degree.

I'd personally find it hard to justify using k8s / preferring availability just for this. Also, a core principle of SRE is having an error budget that you want to actually spend (i.e. having services that are \*too\* reliable is \*bad\*). I'd be a bit apprehensive to hire a senior whose recommendation is ""reliability at the cost of everything else"".## Too much human reliance""A justification in the PR, and/or""Personally, not a big fan of answers that boils down to ""let humans do this X process"". Humans are faulty, and manual processes tend to get ignored over time (e.g. people just rubber-stamping the justification).""At each stage, monitor:""This also seems like an extra toil that can be done automatically.In general, adding more bureucracy / slowing down development for the sake of needless reliability is also bad, similar to above.## Seems pretty textbookOverall, your answers give me the vibe of ""recommend the commonly recommended thing, just because that's best practice, without further thought"", like immediately jumping to k8s, specific DB, and so on.In the system design interview, I think I'd personally like to see how you think from the fundamentals and the first principle more, rather than just giving me a list of technologies immediately:- For a simple webapp, do we \*really\* need to use k8s? You're signing up your team to eat a lot of dev / knowledge cost before even hearing the full constraint of the problem.- Before jumping into the details, why not verify more fundamental things? e.g. do we need redundancy across different regions?- NoSQL theoretically scales horizontally better, but is that true in reality? In a lot of cases, there is a mismatch between theory and reality. Similar to how linked list are faster than arrays on paper for some use case, but they tend to be slower in reality due to caching performance.## Random nit'“What’s the default port for a web service?” and I answered 8080.' Incorrect? I'd expect the answer to be 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS. I'd personally shrug it as nervousness / misunderstanding, but maaaaybe there's a small chance of interviewers really disliking it (e.g. ""this person has only ever deployed things on localhost"") since that's a pretty fundamental thing to get wrong.Don't beat yourself up too much though, interview fails sometimes do just happen randomly (e.g. there just happen to be unicorn candidate right after you). From the post, it seems like you're a pretty strong candidate and the interview itself went pretty well.I think the core of the issue is that a senior SRE should be someone who knows why we need to follow mainstream recommendations, and when we should not follow them. I'm not saying you don't have that quality, but I think the way you answer the interview questions did not necessarily demonstrate that due to the textbook answer and overemphasis on reliability above all.",4m_33s,2025-12-11 07:14:56,8,cscareerquestions,t3_1pjlsx3,False,

Concrete metrics make your experience more verifiable and demonstrate production impact.For system design—your answers were directionally correct. The feedback about being more concrete is key.

The only tools available to do it were reading books and trying to decipher someone else's code. I'd look for code snippets on how to do things, view-source on web pages to figure out how they got it to look that way, even fiddle with hex editors on save files to try and figure out how to modify save data before trainers were a thing.If I could have asked AI, it likely would have given me 90% of what I was looking for immediately. I wouldn't have the same level of problem solving skills because I simply wouldn't have been forced to bang my head against a problem until I figured it out.I think it's similar to why the adventure game genre like King's Quest/Myst/Monkey Island/etc just aren't popular anymore.

ntiyu16,"This is a tough one. I work in SF as a DS in big tech and have been in the industry for more than ten years. My thoughts: First priority should be taking the job that fits what you actually want to do. Working a job that you just don't care about will feel miserable at some point. The startup sounds like it would be more interesting to me, but that's just my take.Decide how much you actually care about tech work. Most Bay Area tech companies expect you to be more committed than just seeing it as a 9-5, and IME most workers here have a genuine interest in the work they do outside of just getting a paycheck. If you are going to find it difficult to care about what you're working on after 5pm, definitely don't join the startup. Tbh your best chance for an honest 9-5 might be working as a SWE at a non-tech company, which you could probably transition into from either role. If you do care enough about the work that you want to progress to senior+ and stay in the industry, the best place to start is a company with good product, good process, and smart co-workers. The startup sounds more like that. Finally, living down in Silicon Valley is indeed a very different social scene. I've done it and tbh I enjoyed it, but for a young person that wants to go out and be social it will seem tremendously boring. This is actually a pretty big QoL consideration, and you should consider it seriously. Generally I don't recommend reneging on an offer, but it sounds like living in SF would make a big difference to you. I would probably rather renege than sacrifice my social life for 1-2 years. However, if you think the grind of working at a startup will make you miserable, you may want to just stick with your current offer and try to find some flexibility or hope jobs in 1-2 years.",CracticusAttacticus,2025-12-11 20:28:11,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1pk2tdp,False,

A chance to try to find good housemates to split the huge rent bills. You may not even need a car... although having a car or access to a shared car is a good thing because traveling around California is strongly recommended.My guess is company 1 is in south bay, which if you lived down there, could have higher rent and much harder to get around than SF, because public transit just isn't good enough for daily activities.

nt6ppw1,"Self taught staff eng here.My two cents is since you have limited bandwidth, any time you spend on personal organization/""meta"" things like flash cards and pomodoro timers and study plans and color-coded highlighter markers are actually distractions away from ""the things you actually are looking to learn"".My approach to learning has always been to tinker with technology. If you're having issues w/ lack of vocabulary/articulation, chances are that your fundamentals are lacking. You can go about filling the gaps either in a top-down way (e.g. start from what you know and work ""downwards"" into lower levels) or bottom-up (e.g. start from from C/ASM and work your way up back to high level).The former tends to be a more pragmatic form of learning. You can, for example, go from knowing about calling fetch (vs whatever is the abstraction for it in your favorite framework) to RPC/REST to HTTP spec (what different headers do, etc) or go from ORMs to raw SQL to reading about db normalization, etc.The bottom-up approach is useful for getting stronger at fundamentals, e.g. reading source code for hashmap implementations in various languages can help you understand how they actually work wrt memory layout, complexity, etc.With that said, senior level isn't necessarily about those. There's some level of importance in being able to accurately convey technical ideas via jargon, but equally (or perhaps more) important is communicating at an appropriate level for the audience (e.g. a junior vs a director).

Do 2 problems at least a night (1 hr) If you have to redo easys until you get it, do that. I would say spend 10 min on ur own on the problem if you can’t figure it out watch neetcode solution - then do it and then wait two days and try and do it on ur own and then if you forget watch the solution again. Copy and paste all ur solutions in a Google doc so u can go back to them (cause you most likely will have pseudo code next to it). Keep doing this with the easys until ir makes sense to you and you can technically explain what is happening, watching neetcode solution more than once will help you because you will start speaking technically and confidently. And then when you’re good at all the problems u previously did time box yourself for 30 min to work on the same problem - pretend it’s an interview by then u will be confident because you have done this easy problem more than once. And just repeat for mediums and hards (time box 60 min) Maybe you should also go back to the fundamentals in the language ur comfortable using (w3 schools), relearning OOP principles and other things you might have forgotten. Use ai to help you study, ask it to ask you interview question and then you write the answer or if you don’t know what the algorithm solution is doing when reviewing the solution ask it to go through each iteration. Also ask DeepSeek (ai I use) to make you a study plan. But regardless you should do hacker hour where no matter what you do 1 hr of algorithms (at least 2 problems a day).

nt6737m,"Well, one tip I have is *any* time you hear an acronym or jargon you don't know, don't be afraid to ask. Yeah you can Google it on the side, but a lot of times it's easier to briefly pause the meeting and have it explained by the person doing the talking. It signals that you're paying attention and willing to learn. I've had a lot of positive feedback about my willingness to do that, from both the business folks using acronyms I don't know and colleagues who were similarly confused but not confident enough to speak up.Honestly it sounds like you're selling yourself short a bit. I had some excellent mentors that beat in the idea of advocating for yourself in a corporate world, and being willing to make a change if the company you work for won't accommodate that.That said, I also went through a destructive leadership turnover cycle and it fuckin sucked! I was having full on panic attacks and needed to consult a therapist to get through it, and I think I've come out the other side more resilient. So do what you need to do, and if that involves seeking some professional help that's absolutely okay. My therapist likes to remind me that a significant portion of her clients are there for work related anxiety. Software Engineering is a high-stakes, high-stress career field.Oh! Also, therapy exposed that I had a sleeping disorder which caused me a lot of physical symptoms like brain fog, difficulty focusing, and memory problems.

For any concept or specific interaction between technologies I'm not 100% certain about or haven't touched in a while, I make a little sandbox on my personal computer with practical examples that I type out (not paste from google/ai) and play around with it for a day or 2 and leave some notes in markdown in the folder.Sometimes you haven't worked with a technology in depth for months, I come back to those folders in such times and its a quick memory boost, imo more than you'd get if you simply read up on it or googled a singular question.Flashcards are decent for interviews but imo not amazing for in depth knowledge.2. Intelligence can't be faked (at least when working with intelligent people), trying to sound smart isn't a cool look. The people who work with you will know how well you know your stuff in the same way that I assume *you* know how well each of your colleagues knows your stuff - usually some are a cut above the rest, no matter where you work.I think you taking the time to write this post shows you care about your knowledge which is frankly more important than how ""smart"" you are in the first place, I'm sure it's really tiring being a sole provider and most people would also have trouble finding the energy to upskill in your shoes. Not always possible, but maybe try stealing a bit of work time to read up/practice if possible, when you're less tired during the day. Best of luck! EDIT: Also, some times you just wont get a promotion - regardless of how well you do, there's many variables deciding who gets promoted - so don't take it to heart.

I never went to a bar when I was in college, so I didn’t have much use for cheap Jeopardy-like information that I was learning.In my five years of university, I think I actually enjoyed maybe two or three classes. The coolest one was data science, where we used algorithms in Python like k-nearest neighbor to classify clusters of data and iteratively displayed the algorithm converging, which was a pretty neat and beautiful display of mathematics.But the other stuff was like memorizing the five-state diagram of a CPU round-robin task priority queue, and how tasks were transferred from cache memory into RAM and vice versa. Not my cup of tea, and I forgot the information quickly after the test.One class on RISC-V assembly was neat—making a little library to read and write from a text file by meticulously setting up the assembly memory registers. but all in all it was a pretty painful experience and until I get a job the in the field I cannot really recommended it.

I also find this to be a general indication that your stories are too large and need to be broken down more. Agile is all about fast feedback and two weeks to a month (or longer) is too long to go without feedback. If you do shorter sprints, you do need to have much shorter ceremonies as well.If you have on-call during your sprint, you should reduce the number of stories you plan to handle that sprint. Agile is all about prioritizing things and empowering developers. So if the on-call is the highest priority thing, you as a developer should take that into account when planning out the sprint.

The spring framework is rich, learning to leverage its robust ecosystem to solve rudimentary problems is a key to success. The second thing that helped me was understanding design patterns. This one is somewhat controversial. Some people think that they only exist to cover up for language flaws and that they lead to overly abstracted code.

nt2bhvc,"Having been through this a couple times, my advice is to look at how much you're being paid to stay. Deals differ, but in my experience if you're going to get a compelling equity payout, retention bonus, stock grant in the new company or are seen as playing a role in the acquisition (in a way that materially benefits you) you'll probably know about it (even if not exact numbers) within a week or two. If you're not being paid anything, treat it like any new job, and evaluate it on those terms. Would you have applied for this company before they bought your current employer? Are they doing anything exciting? Are they hiring for your role + experience?Also: executive bullshit can get especially thick after deals like this. They likely do have retention bonuses or targeted bonuses for certain milestones even if you don't, and otherwise decent people have a way of rationalizing really shitty behavior when someone dangles enough money in front of them. So, if you're hearing about the 2026 roadmap, that there will be no layoffs, or other stuff that paints a rosy picture around the future, take it with a big grain of salt. They _might_ not be lying outright (or they might be!), but they may have a lot of incentive to hold off a mass exodus even if leaving would be the better move for employees.What I'm reading is that you weren't really happy before this deal, you were serious enough about leaving to have offers on the table relatively quickly after the deal, you're not super jazzed about what the new company is doing (you don't mention this at all in your post), and you're probably not going to get much/any retention $ from this (sorry, but I think you'd know about it by now).

nsu7ckx,"I have a PhD in math, from a US R1 that did not distinguish between pure and applied. My cohort has had a very wide range of outcomes, from people getting big tech/FAANG research jobs to people adjuncting at the local community college and living a low-key life. (I find myself drifting towards the latter, now that I'm closer to 40 than 30 and realize that I'll never want kids or a house in the 'burbs.)The people with the tech research jobs actively sought that out during their PhDs. They found advisors in other departments working on ML, and attended ML seminars, helped run ML workshops, did tech internships, etc. There was a time when generic math/physics/etc PhDs got hired on to these jobs, but Covid slammed that door shut if you weren't actively keeping it open... nowadays, given the market, even getting hired as an SWE or data scientist right out of grad school isn't easy. Being a smart guy/gal who used Sage for your number theory project or MATLAB for your CFD project doesn't really cut it any more.The average time to completion in my program was 6 years. I knew a few people who finished in 4, and a few who stayed for 9-10, but most people got out in 5-7. I was on track to be a 5, until I got scooped, and I ended up making it out in 7. You said it was a foreign PhD program and these tend to be shorter because they expect you to already have an MS coming in and start working on research immediately, but it still raises an eyebrow that you're already 28 and penciling in being out by 32-33. (Mid-30s isn't old by any means, but it is just old enough that you will look around and see a lot of your friends having kids and buying houses, so if you're prone to comparing yourself with people that could gnaw at you.)So I think my gut reaction is this isn't a bad idea, but at least my experience has been that a STEM PhD is not a golden ticket to a high paying tech job any more. You will want to align yourself with that from day one of school if that's your goal. If you drift into doing a pure math or even classical applied math (e.g. CFD, PDEs) thesis, it might not get you where you want to go.edit: sorry, I said ""foreign"" but you're not even from the US, so from your perspective it's not foreign at all!

But using words-ML without understanding fundamentals is like being in grade 1 and using calculator to solve word problems.",mangooreoshake,2025-12-07 05:15:19,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1pg92c5,False,

nsxiohe,Yeah I mean I remember back in school I didn’t even google solutions for problems even though it existed.,ibeerianhamhock,2025-12-08 13:14:37,1,cscareerquestions,t1_nsplgkz,False,
nspn2lu,I’ve read your posts and you seem pretty knowledgeable. Given my scenario what do you think would be the “optimal” thing to do?,Psychological-Idea44,2025-12-07 04:39:18,2,cscareerquestions,t1_nspmdqq,True,
nsoq1y8,Shouldn't hurt your chances.I recently quit a start up to move back to a larger company. Wasn't for me.,WanderingMind2432,2025-12-07 01:05:26,4,cscareerquestions,t3_1pg56t0,False,
nsor1mq,There are also some big tech spinoff companies that like hiring folks who have done good work at startups as well as hiring big tech folks who want something a little different. Some of these jobs are cushy and past initial phases that require the long hours and intense buy in culture.

nsruin8,Quite a few companies have started bc former employees of big tech companies decide to make their own startups and they have ins with VC funding through their network and so forth. You can google the rest if you’re interested. I have friends who work at some but it feels like too personal of information to share over the internet with smaller companies tbh,ibeerianhamhock,2025-12-07 15:26:10,1,cscareerquestions,t1_nsrr9gr,False,
nsqeiy0,Big companies pay more and are less likely to understaff projects. As a staff+ engineer I made 2-5 times as much annually at my last three larger companies compared to my fifth startup.
