And yes, the authority is catching up too, with data engineering getting a real say in architecture, tooling, and governance instead of cleaning up messes after the fact.",VisualAnalyticsGuy,2025-12-04 13:50:53,13,dataengineering,t3_1pdtovo,False,

The work becomes more about shaping the contract between producers and consumers and less about just moving data from A to B. That shift feels pretty fundamental.The biggest change on my side is tighter collaboration cycles. DE gets pulled in earlier when a new product idea forms since everyone knows messy upstream data will kill the project later. Ownership has improved a bit too, mostly because teams finally realized they can’t bolt governance on at the end.It still varies a lot by company, but the places that treat DE as a core layer tend to move faster and spend less time firefighting.

The data you feed it is the fuel and oil. If you constantly put in bad gasoline and never change the oil, the car will still run for a while but over time, performance drops, parts wear out, and things start to break. In the same way, if your AI models are trained on low-quality, inconsistent, or noisy data, it will limit how accurate and reliable their outputs can be, no matter how much tuning you do under the hood.But if you treat your car well use clean, high-quality data, keep things consistent, and regularly monitor and maintain your pipelines it will run smoother, perform better, and be far less likely to produce bad or unpredictable results. data engineering doesn’t magically solve everything, but it can massively improve what your AI capabilities",Sad_Cell_7891,2025-12-04 07:42:56,11,dataengineering,t3_1pdtovo,False,

I work in Norway and rather not describe the industry, as it is such a niche thing that a google search will hit us on page 1 lol - but it is a big and profitable industry :)Current project: establishing Snowflake as a data platform for enabling large-scale internal analytics on structured data. Basically involves: setting pipelines to copy data from operational databases into analytical databases (+ setting up jobs to pre-calculate tables for analysis team)Data size: a few TBs in total, but daily ingestion of < 1Gb.Stack: AWS Lambda (in Python) to write data from AWS RDS as parquet in S3 (triggered by EventBridge daily); (at the moment) Snowflake Tasks to ingest data from S3 into raw layer in Snowflake; Dynamic Tables to create tables in Snowflake from its Raw layer up to user's consumption; PowerBI as BI tool.Architecture choice was to divide our data movement in 2 main parts: \- Part 1: From our operational databases to parquet files in S3 \- Part 2: From parquet in S3 to Snowflake raw layer.Inside Snowflake, other pipelines to move from RAW to analytical-ready layer (under construction/consideration, but most likely will be dbt building dynamic tables) -> so a medallion architecture.The idea was to keep data movement as loosely coupled as possible. This was doable because we dont have low-latency requirements (daily jobs are more than enough for analytics)In my opinion, keeping the software developer mindset while designing architecture was the biggest leverage I had (modularity and loose coupling being the 2 main ones that came to mind).

Here are my two cents *with a twist* on it. **Type of firm** FinOps - SW Procurement and IT Cost Management**Current project brief description** Building Data Platform for Client Expenditure Reports**Data size** \~2B records raw (source), \~1M aggregated (target)**Stack and architecture** PySpark, SQL, Azure (Databricks and SQL Database), GitHub**Brief explanation of the flow** 0. Multiple datasources (files, DBs, APIs) -> 1. DataFactory pipelines, transferring data to Databricks (Catalogs) -> 2. Writing custom transformations (Notebooks) -> 3. Packing them in separate Jobs and scheduling execution -> 4. Transferring data to Azure SQL DB. -> 5. Data used in (PowerBI) reports.**Two cents** I'm working in a small, but very capable team - initially we were a band of three, since recently only two persons, so we get occasional helping hand from SWE Tech Lead when load becomes too big. We don't have dedicated architect nor major restraints regarding stack, other than to have pipelines running inside Azure Databricks (medallion arch ofc). We started this project from scratch, having *all the freedom* regarding implementation. Currently we are in our 8th month, approximately two more to finish this phase (creating and migrating all reports from old to new platform). Biggest lesson learned - **DO NOT** get in love with your code! If project is constantly growing, take time and effort to make sure you **still** have scalable solution. Don't be afraid to completely overhaul your solution. We refactored our complete codebase 2 times already. First time right after our very first successful production run (4 month into the project). It wasn't good for the moral because we put great effort to come up with working solution at that time, but we knew we had to re-do almost everything if we were going to add more things in near future. Felt low-on-fuel, but overall happy with what we had. Second one came just a month after all that, in order to accommodate some intra-company changes... Didn't sit right with us, especially because we were short-staffed at that moment, but went for it. And it's the best thing we could have done! Now we have highly reusable code, flexible to implement any new request and not worry of breaking any existing feature. And finally, the **Twist** If you want to learn more (quickly) about DA, kickstart some personal project! Try to solve something that's dear to you. Leverage available vibe/ai-tools if you want to come up with full-stack solution, trust me it's worth the effort! I've dived into two personal projects since summer (one NBA fantasy related, other for organizing my pick-up basketball group) and I couldn't be happier to see them up and running, and even used by some complete strangers! That way I branched out (and returned) to some other tools, services and methodologies (Airflow, Postgres, Supabase, CORS etc.) which I probably won't touch in my current company. I feel like I've expanded my horizons in more ways and topics from this experience than with any other work/company related one.

They had mainly an old school on-premise solution which was built of multiple siloed data warehouses and depended on tribal knowledge to keep it running. I believe there was one super complicated ETL pipeline that would fail, and they only knew to restart it, until it finally ran. No one bothered to debug why it failed. A combination of older technology, and not managing tech debt because all stable data solutions wander into cost-centre territory where they only care about costs management. Anyway, onto your challenge -Multiple siloed analytics systems, some on-prem, some on private cloud, mish-mash of Azure/Microsoft based solutions and generally no one had a standard approach to data.So we architected a whole new data-mesh(-istic) approach. Hub-and-Spoke architecture built off Databricks for the Hub, bring what you want for the Spoke. Hub is your managed and governed central data lake. Spokes correspond to different domains of the business (Finance, HR, Customer Experience, Investment and so on.).More lower done, we maintain Landing, Bronze, Silver, Silver Plus (meant to hold curated/canonical model, still WIP), with the respective domain spokes having the Gold Layers.Our core idea was the data platform should be a genuine platform. Not just something to build analytics on. So now we can progress to building AI based applications, ontologies and so on without the restrictive mindset of a data platform being only to build data warehouses.For us Databricks has worked like a dream, and barring reporting (Power BI), we haven't considered needing to use it for anything else.

nrz4jbk,"1 and 2 heavily depend on the business needs and what the API is IMO.If this is an API that my company has access to via some contract with another company, I expect the other company to keep the data schema consistent, in which case I'd have my ingestion expect a particular schema. That way, we know right from the ingestion layer if the schema is breaking the contract and we can work to remediate. Then, the pipeline can always assume that schema is enforced and we don't need to worry about missing or unexpected data.If it's some sort of public API that can change at any point, then the approach would probably be a bit different. Just throwing something out there this isn't necessarily how I'd do it, but perhaps store as just raw JSON, then parse out the data we actually need from it, and store that in a known schema (i.e. a bronze layer feeding into a silver layer). Of course, all of this will depend on *how* the API changes, so the real answer is that it has to be handled case-by-case (e.g. if a field is added or removed, but we don't use that field anyway, then we do nothing because it doesn't matter, but if we do use it, then we need to figure out what to do in the particular scenario).3 is again sorta dependent on the use-case. If I have access to the full source dataset and it's only a few thousand records, I wouldn't bother with incrementally loading data. I *might* do something like tracking which rows are new/updated if that's relevant to downstreams in the pipeline, but again, depends on the use case.For 4, I generally prefer loading into a bronze layer (if that's what you mean by ""staging tables""). If it's easy to keep the source data, I don't really see a reason not to do so and to keep it close to the rest of the data (i.e. in the same warehouse). But there are of course cases when this is not desired (for example, if the source data is enormous and is mostly thrown away anyway, then I wouldn't want to waste the cost to store it).For 5\*, I'm not sure what you mean by a ""metadata driven pipeline"".

nrzv5lq,"1) I hardcode the schema in all but a few cases where I expect schema drift. For those cases I just append new columns and null missing ones for the incoming data set. In most cases I don't expect the schema to change so I want to know when it does since it could have impacts to downstream functions.2) Answered above. You can't remove old columns from the schema since there is old data likely using them.3) Full load if possible. My main reasons are that it's quick and if your source deletes rows without a method for getting which rows are deleted, an incremental update won't pick them up. This is very much dependent on a number of factors, so quite often a full load isn't the best option.4) If you have a need for a staging table, use it. If not, don't complicate things because it fits the design pattern you saw on a YouTube video.5) First time I've heard of this, but I read your explanation in a different comment. If you can use that pattern, go right ahead, I'm all for code deduplication. I think for a lot of people though, and certainly me, it would be far more trouble than it's worth. I work with about a dozen products from various vendors each with their own API auth methods, pagination rules, and return schemas. To try and cram all that into a generic pipeline would be a nightmare of if statements and rule exceptions. It just wouldn't work in my case. Dedicated pipelines are isolated so I know I can change one without it affecting anything else. I can see a generic pipeline having to be tested against everything it calls whenever a change is made to any one of them.If you have a setup where most pipelines use a similar setup, then yeah I can see it being useful, that's not my environment.",Shadowlance23,2025-12-03 02:11:36,3,dataengineering,t3_1pcms0m,False,

When new fields are added or removed from the schema, how do you handle this? Concept 4: Staging tables. After ingesting data from API and assuming flattening to tabularI think these concepts are all related. With JSON, you can just insert the JSON payload into a JSONB field with whatever fields happen to be in the JSON payload. So flattening wouldn't be necessary. And since flattening isn't necessary, you don't have to worry about whether fields are included, deleted, omitted, etc. from one payload to the next. Just query it using SQL with the JSON features that the database provides.Querying raw JSON using SQL is still relatively new. Some databases (e.g. postgres) are excellent at it.

nsqc820,"Few thoughts\- How good an option moving home is depends on where you are from, what the economics are. If you're in the UAE and you feel trapped, makes me wonder if you're from a developing country where UAE is offering a good alternative.\- People with jobs are almost always more attractive to employers than people without. Is there a reason searching for new jobs while staying in your current job is not an option? Could you search for different jobs in UAE or at home whilst still in your current one?\- 5 hour commute is absolutely insane. Doing anything you can, even accepting worse housing options or conditions, or paying more for housing, may be worth getting back that time. Even if you had one hour back from commute, that's 1 hour you could develop your skills, or meditate and try and separate yourself from the stress of work, or search for jobs, or just relax. Giving you more personal time will multiply your effectiveness both at work, at self improvement, and at pushing your career.\- freelance or remote work seems extremely difficult and competitive. It will probably need you to be good at optimising your offerings to clients, being a good salesman, good at negotiating more work,, etc etc. If you are struggling with stakeholder management at your UAE job, this may not be the way.\- Real life experience >>>> bootcamps and self driven projects, unless you are very good at learning real life 2skills from self driven projects (past positive achievements in this would be a green flag).\- Again back to the jobs thing, bootcamps, freelance, etc puts you in the desparate masses of unemployed tech. Having an actual, real data job elevates you above everyone else in the bottom of the barrel. Don't take your foot out of the door unless you are ok with it closing, or you have another door open elsewhere.\- For your UAE job, you have to step back from your tech focus and focus on people skills, expectations management, and building alliances.1. Find smart, driven people in the org who understand you and are receptive to the problems. Recruit them as allies. Find out what they need and support them. Example from my work. Normally, cybersecurity and data have an adversarial relationship. Data wants to move data and make it accessible, cyber wants to say no, to wrap everything in paperwork. But by meeting with the cybersecurity guy, saying noone in my dept cares about cybersecurity, wants to make it happen, I want to do it, help me, we become friends. I speak up for cybersecurity in my department, he is careful with how he rolls out cybersecurity (he avoids saying ""no"" reflexively because he knows I can be trusted, and he needs to balance security vs useablity), he speaks up for my data needs as a precondition for effective security in meetings, etc.2. Your job sounds like a consultant job. Consultants have the problem all the time of being parachuted into crazy broken situations with clients who want everything fixed, but don't have much money and are defensive about change (dogwithfrisbeeinmouthmeme.jpg - only fix, no diagnose or make us look bad!). This is a huge industry so learn from consultants about how to come in, get the client on your side, help talk them around to fixes without making them look bad, change management, etc etc. Youtube, books etc might be a help here.3.

nseuetb,"As others already said it sounds like a process, standardization and best practice issue.\>  pipelines that work “sometimes” but fail silentlyI'd recommend making heavy use of Airflow retries, fail\_stop (AF2)/ fail\_fast (AF3), timeouts and of course callbacks for notifications. A production pipeline should never fail silently. If the issue is more on the SLA side you can use an observability tool external to Airflow that supports SLAs or a control Dag that flags if a Dag that should have run did not. Also make sure you have a good way to forward issues to the person who developed the prototype so there is a feedback loop to catch patterns that cause production issues.\>  too many moving parts (Airflow jobs + custom scripts + cloud functions) That one is tricker, might help to have a more defined CICD workflow and if it is not the case yet having everything in version control, so no part gets changed without validating the change does not break anything. Also clear code ownership.\> no single place to see what’s running, what failed, and whyThe budget solution here is to add Airflow Dags that check what is running and what failed (control Dag again), the fancier solution is to add lineage to your deployment and evaluate that through an observability tool.\> models stuck because infra isn’t readyMight be helpful to orchestrate infra provisioning from within the same pipeline as the models with a setup task before the model related tasks and a teardown one afterwards.\> engineers spending more time fixing orchestration than building featuresThere is an upfront time cost but all of the above should help with this. :)\> business teams waiting weeks for something that “worked fine in the notebook”Same; that hopefully will get faster once the processes and best practices are in place.

What I've done before is trying to explain it like this:The notebook is like having working prototype of a car. We can drive it around, verify that it runs great. But having the feature/model in production means we have to make many cars automatically, build a whole car factory.

nslb56t,"Hmm, tricky. So you're computing over long baseline rolling windows, and you're wrestling with the fact that- old records can receive long-delayed updates- that could meaningfully change your past computed values- bringing those values closer to 'the truth'- but the source system has no recorded update timestamp that you could use to decide which data to include in the batch, only a unique ID for each record?(Before I suggest something, let me just note that there's a solution space that involves talking to whomever it is that controls the upstream and persuading them about the merits of SCD fields. But assuming that's not an option:)How about this:- you have to load _all_ data into GCS every day because of the lack of update timestamps- use GCS lifecycle rules to quickly move old data into archival storage: you're not going to need it unless you need to run the entire process from the top- in your warehouse, create staging tables:1. CDC table, which persists (more on this below)2. today's batch, overwritten entirely every day, simple upload from GCS3. change table, created every day by comparing (1) with (2) to find rows that have changed (for example, using `EXCEPT DISTINCT` if supported by your warehouse)Now, the idea is to update the CDC table using the change table. It should have a couple of extra columns vs the source: `valid_from` and `valid_until`. You filter on `valid_until IS null` when constructing the change table, to get the latest version of each record. Otherwise, you ignore these columns when constructing the change table.If a row with a certain ID appears in the change table, you first need to update its latest record in the CDC table, such that `valid_until` is changed from `null` to yesterday's date. That record now tells you that the row changed in today's batch; it had those values yesterday, but not today.Finally, you insert the new version of the row (from the change table) into the CDC table, setting `valid_from` to today's date and `valid_until` to `null`: this is now the current version of the row.I think this gets you where you need to be:- the CDC table is a persistent record of all changes- it can be rebuilt from scratch in an emergency, by iterating the above process over the old data batches in GCS archival storage- you can `SELECT * FROM cdc_table WHERE valid_until IS null` to build the current version of the data; you can then compute your rolling window over _that_ table",PaddyAlton,2025-12-06 13:38:18,32,dataengineering,t3_1pfna3x,False,

nsvaoe0,"Im going for simplicity:Instead of upserting as an ingestion pattern, I would instead append the full source table to your raw table in GCP. Uses the fact that storage is cheap and keeps the ingestion simple and straightforward.During ingestion, add an extracted_at timestamp column. Afterwards as a post-processing step, dedup by keeping the record with the most recent extracted_at timestamp per unique key (using row_number() over the composite key partition for example). Index/cluster on the timestamp and composite unique key for performance.If recording the exact changes (SCD2) is not part of the current requirement, I think this approach keeps the ingestion simple, produces less logic to maintain, and is flexible enough to allow for a more complex logic in the future when the need arises (you can recompute/backfill as you have all of the raw data).You always keep the most recent version of each unique entitiy in your table, thereby having an exact copy of source. This approach also handles deletes in source.Lastly the real solution here is collaboration with the upstream owners of the data. Sit with them and figure out if there is a way to add a CDC field to the source. Or ingest with cdc on logs.

Only other requirement being to retain historical data that the source system will eventually drop after 6 months.

Good support here would mean we don’t have to use spark for everything, tons of enterprises would adopt it, and it would disrupt the big players compute oriented business models.

Only problem is that the read_blob fetch mechanism loads all data at once instead of just the batch being fetched. The incremental fetch loading works fine for read_parquet though. For now I have a workaround where I load all the metadata by not reading the content and then incrementally calling read_blob with a batch of filenames from the metadata at a time, but would be nice to just natively support incremental result loading to make the experience more seamless and approachable. https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-python/discussions/92",Global_Bar1754,2025-12-03 19:11:15,1,dataengineering,t3_1pd6oce,False,

ns0iu89,"AQE is usually good. You would default to relying on it, and only change things if something seems to have gone awry. For example we recently had it include a shuffle step to rebalance files, but we were rewriting 50TB of data and it just flooded the spill space and crashed.The old 200 default is almost never a good number. It ends up spending more time finalising tasks and spinning up new ones than it does actually processing things (may be slight exaggeration). The ideal number on a fixed-worker-count cluster is 2x the number of cores on the workers, and then higher multiples of that if you have significantly skewed data in large amounts.Even with AQE you might be able to guide it to a better plan by lining up data nicely for it. But I wouldn't necessarily worry about it until something is taking longer than it seems it should and is taking long enough that it is worth optimising.There are other approaches that can help as well. Saving intermediate results somewhere so that it can be reused without relying on cache memory being available as well as truncating the query plan. You can also focus on dropping the descriptive data and just moving keys and filter-by columns for all the major join work, create a unique composite key for each row, then send that back to the original descriptive data then re-join everything on the new unique row key. That minimises shuffles if you have multiple different keys to join on, because you're only reshuffling the keys, and you shuffle all the extra data just once.",azirale,2025-12-03 04:39:42,1,dataengineering,t1_nrz130a,False,

nrwm7xu,"Disclaimer: I work in the data platform space (founder of Bruin), so take this as general guidance, not a pitch. The best option really depends on your company size, how your teams are structured, and what your current stack looks like (MSSQL 2016, lake, warehouse, etc.). Also helpful to know how you orchestrate things today; Airflow, SSIS, cron, notebooks, whatever.One thing I’d definitely think about is choosing asset-based orchestration instead of task-based. Task-based tools like Airflow or SSIS focus on tasks, not data, so lineage ends up shallow, incomplete, or manually maintained. You also get a lot of glue code that makes governance harder. Asset-based tools like Dagster, dbt, or Bruin treat data assets as the core unit, which gives you proper lineage, clear dependencies, and a cleaner way to centralize metadata and governance. If your goal is a single referential for governance, this approach saves a lot of pain later.Regarding OpenMetadata: it’s a good open-source option, but it’s not light. You’ll spend time maintaining connectors, and lineage quality depends on how your SQL is written. Glossary, business rules, RACI, etc., also take time to set up. It works well in mature teams that can own it.You can also look at metadata-first platforms like DataHub if your priority is lineage and visibility over heavy enterprise governance. Sometimes that’s enough depending on your size.Just keep in mind that no tool magically creates governance. You still need a central team, standards, ownership, and a gradual rollout.

The answer might disappoint you but it will help you decide on next steps.The most likely situation is that you will be stuck in your current role for a period of time. You will need to make the most of it. The upside to this is that you are directly involved in customer onboarding and therefore revenue generation, so your job is likely to be safer than the developers.To do that I would push standardisation of projects as strongly as you can.

For example, comprehensive validation and data quality checks, with automatically generated reporting outputs.You can follow a similar approach to reporting: standardise and automate.

Ensure idempotency of the pipeline, have test cases for the transformations. The list is infinite. So just validate, test and log against the things that you feel are most pressing.

Essentially, cron lets you schedule a script to automatically run on a schedule. For example, if you want to run the feedback loop (let's call it \`feedback.py\`) every 6 hours, you would simply edit the crontab. This is done directly in your shell by running \`crontab -e\`. Then add the following line: \`0 \*/6 \* \* \* /path/to/your/script/feedback.py\`.This tells your server to execute the \`/path/to/your/script/feedback.py\` scripts every 6 hours.

It all comes down to your needs, if you have only a couple of standard sources / destinations, you can use a pre-built no code tool, even though i do not like tools that have a vendor lock-in with no open source option. But i am a developer, so for a DE team that has no dedicated software engineers, they may be an option, but keep in mind that those tools usually are hardly extendable, so if in the future you come across an exotic datasource that you cannot read with them, you have to build bridges (like python scripts as an intermediary step) that write the data into a database from which the tool then can read and so on...My recommendation: If you have dedicated software engineers, use something like dlthub, if not, you may consider something like windsor.

To me this isn’t about blocking marketing or “never letting them make technical decisions.” That’s gatekeeping, and it usually creates more tension than it solves.Marketing people are adults. They can understand trade-offs and deal with consequences just like everyone else. The real problem is usually not who suggested a tool, but who actually owns the process and the outcomes.If ingestion is owned by the data team, then the data team should make the final call. If marketing owns the workload and carries the operational risk, then they can make the decision. Just make ownership explicit and you avoid the “how could you allow this?” gaslighting scenario entirely.Also, you don’t want to become the “no person” who rejects every tool non-engineers propose. That kills collaboration. Better approach is:1. define the owner 2. list the requirements 3. evaluate trade-offs together 4. let the owner decideSometimes a no-code tool is the right choice. Sometimes it isn’t. But shutting non-technical teams out of the decision entirely almost always backfires.",PolicyDecent,2025-12-03 07:48:23,1,dataengineering,t1_ns0z7do,False,

Agree on an exit path upfront: how to export raw data, how to rehydrate if you leave, and who funds the switch.Pressure-test vendor lock-in: do they support CDC or at least webhooks, raw landing in object storage, and schema-change handling? Add simple data contracts for key tables so ownership survives tool swaps.Stack-wise, Windsor could handle common marketing connectors; keep dlt for oddball sources; Airbyte is a nice middle when you need open-source and extendable.

It was a home computer where everything was inside a keyboard you plugged into the TV and you could write BASIC programs and play games by loading them on a cassette tape drive. Yeah, those things that took whole minutes to load part of a game.Anyway, I was hooked. It looked so cool. You could make the computer do anything you could think of.I loved games and fancied myself a future game programmer.I didn't take any classes (there weren't really any back then, where I was from)I didn't LEARN programming, like sitting in front of a machine doing lessons. I wanted to try something, tried to research what I needed to do to accomplish it, and tried it out.I made many, many things along the way and most of the time, it was, ""for fun"".As an example, in the early 2000's the MMORPG Ragnarok became popular around the world (and in south east asia). I came across some code that could extract and view the 3D models of maps and buildings in the Ragnarok data file and decided I wanted to make a program that would let you look around the map as you wanted using WASD controls.Thus RagCam was born, and it was shared in some communities.I was also able to find some code to import 3D models into the then popular 3D software 3D Studio max. I also made a system tray Desktop Toy that let you ""Store Files"" in the ""Kafra Storage"" A Kafra is a NPC in the game that you interact with to store stuff, and I made a program that pops up the image of the anime-style girl in a kid of maid outfit where you can store notes and files.When I got into pirating (ahem, ""streaming"") TV shows I wanted to get notified if there was a new episode, so I made a local site that checked for updates. I also made a scraper that downloaded (english) subtitles based on the file name.I try to make programs that intersect or tanget my interests, which include anime, games, emulation of retro consoles, and more recently AI generated images.It's really up to you to define what programming means to you,I'm an old soul, and for me programming is more than just a way to earn money or the latest technology and cool frameworks.It's an interface between me and my inner self. A way to self-express through technology.Make programming fun. It's all about you.In the corporate world, I did some fun stuff.

Then capitalize the first letter ever. What are separators? space, comma, priod, exclamation, question.

(use an array for implementation)Loop through the word, add one to bucket as you come across the matching letter. ADD: Then we go through the whole list... If any bucket shows >1, it's not an isogram. ADD: But can we go even faster? Do we need to check the whole word? No, we can say ""not isogram"" when we discover the FIRST repeated character. We don't need to got through the whole word. ADD: So we loop through the word, +1 to bucket of matching letter. But before you add 1, check if the bucket is 1 or 0. If it's 1, this is a repeat letter, then you exit the loop and answer ""not isogram"".

If there are no such resources, then it's understandable that you've turned to using a tool (AI) that genuinely can help a beginner write a moderately complex program. Though I don't use it for certain reasons, and I don't really recommend using it, I don't think there's shame in using it for this purpose.However, if there are resources available to you, especially professors or teaching assistants you can talk to, I advise you to go to them with your questions. You can also look online for help with some of the more common pitfalls.The key thing I will emphasize is that there is usually some frustration and discipline required in order to ""get"" what your program is doing (or isn't doing, if you've run into a bug). Staring blankly at the screen or turning to AI for an attempt at a quick fix won't do much to resolve the root problem, which is a lack of understanding. And to understand sometimes really does require you to step through your program one line at a time with a debugger, printing things out along the way, until you know exactly what your program is doing.If you're just struggling to get any code written, it's best to start by breaking the problem down into smaller tasks. For example, you said the game uses a 4x4 grid. My first thought would be: how am I representing this grid? Probably it's useful to know if a part of a ship is on a grid cell or if it's just water. That might lead you to the idea to represent the grid as an array of bools, where a cell holds true if a part of a ship is there and false if not. That's not necessarily ""the best"" way to do it, it's just a way. As a beginner you're not expected to come up with the best or fastest or prettiest solution, it just needs to work.It also helps to translate your ideas into plain English and then into pseudocode before writing any actual code. The jump from thoughts in your head or words in an assignment specification to real code is usually too much when you're just starting, except for the really simple things. If you go straight to writing code, you'll usually end up running into errors or bugs that aren't easy to fix because you haven't thought enough about what your program should really be doing yet. Better to do that thinking up front, write the key things down, write pseudocode that roughly represents what you wrote, and then translate the pseudocode into real code. As you get more experience you can skip/truncate some of these steps, but it's rarely a waste of time to be diligent in this way, in my experience.",Sorlanir,2025-12-03 09:36:41,1,learnprogramming,t3_1pcv7w2,False,

The advice that served me well when I started 20-ish years ago (I’m 40 now) was this: early in career, build broad base general skills and allow your curiosity to drive casual exploration of niche disciplines -> later in career build specialized skills in what you’re most interested in and what you can get a job in, both. The way I did this: 1. Python and C were my broad base languages. I learned them well and chose them because they’re used everywhere. Early on, I focused on design patterns and learning the abstract algebra and category theory that explains why those design patterns work. I also focused on getting really good at C and Python intending to keep them as my core language. 2. From there in 2013 I noticed functional programming was gaining traction, so I decided to learn Haskell. After that I got put on a project at my company that required Scala and I excelled at it because knowing Python, C, and Haskell gave me an edge over other engineers who didn’t have all three (especially Haskell). That set me apart and enabled me to get good at Akka, Spark, and later Cats Effect, which propelled me into Big Data. Also given the landscape at this time I was forced to learn Java :man_shrugging_light_skin_tone:, I didn’t care for it and more or less endured it. 3. At this point as a mid level engineer I’d now gotten exposure to low-level and embedded C, desktop development, server development and database programming, web development, streaming development, microservices, data science, big data engineering involving batch and mini batch processing and data ingestion, machine learning, AI, procedural OOP, and functional programming through Haskell and Scala.4. I discovered I liked the problems and wild-west style complexity of big data environments so I chose to specialize in that. That prompted me to focus on Scala FP for streaming (Cats Effect, Akka) and Spark (batch and mini batch), Python (PySpark, Pandas, Scikitlearn, Airflow, etc), and Go (Kubernetes and other distributed system type stuff). In 2025 it’s still doing really well for me. I was able to learn all of this stuff by taking about an hour a day 4-ish days a week plus 2-4 hours on Saturday a couple times a month in the first 5-10 years of my career to work on personal exploration type of stuff and choosing to stay focused on one thing long enough to really know it (when I got curious about something, I would add it to a list I kept for that to give me the feeling that I would get to it even though I knew I wouldn’t - but I did pick from that list when I finished something and wanted to pick up something new).",owp4dd1w5a0a,2025-12-07 15:27:48,2,learnprogramming,t3_1pgatf9,False,

ns7mbew,"Basic project management, and this is something that I fought with every day in my former job as PMO head.If your job is to manage a software project, then you need to act like a project manager, not a software developer. Project management is pretty simple (in theory), but often difficult for technically-oriented people. For example, the manufacturing department came to us (IT) and told us that they were developing a new product and putting up a new production building for it. The project was assigned to an ERP solution architect, who immediately saw that this is an ERP project - implementing a new BOM (bill of materials) and warehouse management for the new site. This was designed, built, tested, and delivered. But, because he was an ERP solution architect, and not a trained project manager, he completely ignored the whole infrastructure side of the project - it was a new building, so it needed cabling, WiFi routers, client devices, and a new conference room. This only popped up a few weeks before the ""ribbon cutting"" on the new site, when someone came around and asked when we were going to install the hardware, and no one knew what he was talking about. We were literally pulling cables inside the building while the CEO was outside talking to the local news teams announcing the start of production. So, my advice to anyone who is given a project to lead: First, stop and think. Ask yourself if you really see the ENTIRE problem that needs to be solved. THEN break it down into manageable chunks, and plan each one of those in terms of resources and efforts. Once the plan has been agreed and the necessary resources are on board, THEN you start designing the solution (either traditional/sequential project, or a series of agile sprints).",Count2Zero,2025-12-04 07:35:55,1,learnprogramming,t3_1pds1dq,False,

One day I stumbled across a video from Brian Vaughn on virtualization, a design that allows data grids to “infinite scroll” as you only render what is coming into the viewport and immediately unmount those elements when they are out of view. I had used well known libraries for this prior, but watching his presentation gave me an insight into “how” he implemented this idea in his library react-virtualized.I went off and tried to build my own little library that could do the same. I dropped the “I’m not gonna re-invent the wheel” mindset, and instead just said I’m gonna sit here and get something working if it takes me all month. Instead of querying GPT for answers, I just broke it down into small bites. “How do I unmount something when it goes out of view? How do I detect when something is coming into view?” Etc.” In the end, my little library worked well enough for me to be super proud that I figured this out, and the amount I learned during the process was pretty wild. I use this example because it was the first of what would become many of these little “let me see if I can make a basic version of this” exercises.

Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.Make TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack. EDIT: fill in the rest of the REST/CRUD stuff.Now for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.Do this with every small project you work on. An address book, a small online store, an invoice payment processing system, inventory management system.

Forms - use HTML and CSS to create nicely layed out ""interactive"" forms with input-fields and buttons, that don't really do anything.7. (optional) interactive HTML elements, `dialog`, `details`, etc.8. JS introduction - using document.queryselector to select elements and change their class.9.

JS forms - receive form submissions in JS code, read values from forms, write to console12. JS DOM manipulation - write JavaScript code to modify page content, modify form-values13.

nsx103x,"Tldr: I dont understand your question or what your friend is saying... because data structures and algorithms are used in literally every programming language... below is a rant clarifying what I believe is what info you're missing. At the end of the day it doesn't matterIm assuming by DSA you are referring to Data Structures and algorithms right?Those are used in every single programming language, the only difference you may be hearing about is that some languages differences and not actually related to anything about data structures or algorithms... No shade meant by this, but that is something I think someone with an AI/ML background would be familiar with so I am going to assume it's not necessarily an AI background in the sense that you an ML engineer, and possibly what you mean is more that you use AI. I only say that to preface that I'll try and explain what I mean about languages, not to cast aspersions.Anyway, what you may be hearing i suspect, especially because of the recommended languages you've received, is more related to low and high level programming languages. You know all code eventually becomes machine language, ones and zeros is the name of the game, but we dont type out ones and zeros, we use words that them selves get converted to something, then something else, then something else, then eventually something a machine can understand. In coding terms these are layers of abstractions, something ""represents"" something else, and the magic is often that you can hide complexity by having thing X not only translated to thing Y, but also do Z as well to make the statement more concise. Low level languages (like C++) are ones that you work closer to the hardware, meaning there are fewer abstractions away from giving a computer 1s and 0s. This can be a very good thing, abstractions require effort, and that means you can write code that uses less effort on the machines end and make things go fast and use less memory. However, abstractions are done for a reason, and the flip side of a low level language is that you will write a lot more code to do the same thing that another language may be able to do in a fraction of the amount of lines of code, a big pain point being you end up handling memory yourself at this level. High level languages on the other hand are abstracted a more layers up and hide the scary bits like memory management from the developer by handling it themselves, and tend to be much closer to readable human language as a result. Python and Java are both high level languages, but keep in mind that doesnt make them better or worse, just different. So why isnt everything done with a high level language if they can take away all the annoying things that exist in programming? With abstractions come trade offs, the more that your code does ""for you"" the less control you have. You dont have to do annoying memory management and consider a lot of stuff when programming in a language like Python like when its OK for your app to ""forget"" something to free up memory. In languages at this level a feature that is built in handles it for you by occasionally checking the app, and deleting unused memory and freeing it up for later, its called a garbage collector, and this does not exist at the low level, and not having it can be a pain in the ass. But what happens if garbage day is on Monday, and you forget to bring out your trash and today is Tuesday...? You are stuck with the garbage until the garbage man comes around next week, in high level languages this happens to because its not a constant process and works kind of in cycles. Low Level languages can create memory, use it, and the second its no longer needed free it up for something else to use that memory. This allows more efficiency in your code, but requires more dev work, and opens up Pandora box and can lead to an exponentially amount of new bugs or issues. If I wrote 2 programs in Python and C++ tonight, I could do it. But I promise you that my Python will without question be faster than my C++ code. Is Python ""faster"" than C++? Nope, I just am a novice at C++, I know enough to be dangerous, but beyond that 9 times out of 10 my Python is faster due to my own lack of experience with it. And if you told me to create an app in 10 hours or I will die, Ill choose Python every time because the high level abstractions lead to increased developer speed. NOT better app, NOT faster code, less of my time as a developer being used (which in theory could be used to make more code for some other project or learn something new)As far as data structures and algorithms are concerned, they are not language specific, it makes no sense to frame it that way imo. Data structures are ways to organize data. Algorithms are sequences to process data. The programming languages are like syntax in verbal languages, DSA is kinda like forming complex sentences. So there's no correct answer to your question, because it doesnt really make sense. I suppose if you goal is to learn data structures and algorithms at a granular level and really understand how the computer really handles them, a low level language will force you to really get down to that level and put the work in to learn that stuff. If your goal is to apply data structures and algorithms more than learn the granular details, a high level language is the choice. Honestly even that dichotomy isn't a super great way to put it, its just the closest way I could think to answer your question in a way that gives you something to consider. Another way to put that is that learning DSA concepts in a lower level language will expose you more closely to how a computer really uses data structures and algorithms, giving you a better baseline. However, a high level language will allow you to learn these concepts faster and more efficiently. There's no avoiding learning them, and neither path is correct. That being said... if you truly ""know"" python... to be honest you should already be familiar with a lot of data structures and algorithms, so my recommendation would be to stick with Python and fill up those holes in your skill set without having to learn these concepts and a whole new language at the same time slowing the process.

They're teaching you grammar and syntax - enough to be dangerous, but it's only just the start. These tutorials and materials NEVER teach you how to USE the language, and they can't. There's so much nuance and detail and intuition that it can't be captured - you can't just be told.So yeah, this is the time they call ""tutorial hell"", where you learn the hard way that there ARE NO tutorials that carry you to where you want to go. You burn yourself out on that before you accept your fate, and it's hard work from here.And I hope you're over this hump already, but learning C++ won't teach you how to make a game.

You need to learn concepts like collision, frustums and culling, the light equation, model hierarchies, graph theory, inverse kinematics, audio, input, networking, shaders, normal mapping, texture mapping, gameplay, then you've got design, you'll probably want some embedded scripting like Lua, you'll need to support assets and their file formats...It's best if you pick up the maths, because you can't avoid that one, and that you then use an engine that implements all the bits you're not interested in doing yourself.

This has been very suitable for the C# .NET Entity Framework applications Ive maintained so far, however your experience may vary. If you like reading, I would highly suggest familiarizing yourself with Clean Architecture and Domain Driven Design first before delving into derivatives like Microservices, Vertical Slices or even Moduliths. There is good material on it by Robert C. Martin, Martin Fowler and Eric Evans.If not, set your own standards for how you want to name classes for specific patterns (i.e.: Builders, Repositories, Controller, Services, etc.) and then decide a folder structure (like most layered: Application, Domain and infrastructure) and rules for which classes may be defined in which folder structure.Your goal should be to make your code more resilient to the ""big ball of mud"", essentially trying to keep it ""easy to change"".

nsh845e,"Okay, lets see if I can explain this.First of all, Software Architecture is a planned design philosophy. Its how you organize your written code and decide on common styles so to compromise on writing ""same"" code across time as well as people. This is incredibly valuable, since you will recognize old or foreign code much easier, saving time on debugging, additions, modifications, etc. If Coding Guidelines define how you write code within a method, then Architecture is everything beyond that: Methods, Classes, Dependencies of Classes, Modules and Projects. However, its distinct from System Architecture, because it really doesnt ""care"" how which system or component is talking or integrating with another outside of code.From what I understand, project codebase organization is less a ""how do you code"" but more of a ""where are the files"". Software Architecture doesnt care if you use Github or TortoiseSVN nor does it care which IDE you use (on a high level, this actually isnt quite true).MVC is Microsofts take on a 3 Layered architecture (Model View Controller), MVT presumably is djangos version of the same thing, then there is the Onion/Clean Architecture that separate layers into Domain, Application and Infrastructure, sometimes even adding Contract and Presentation...The goal with all these is the same thing. Each layer is given an access hierarchy as well as a specific type of issue to address. This is an overhead and sometimes cumbersome but it ensures that you deal with specific problems in appropriate places and dont risk needing to rewrite your whole application just because your database got an update.MVC's approach decided to disregard making your application incredibly dependent on the used technologies, meanwhile Clean Architecture is the very opposite of that. Its why their structures are different. Some other Architectures like Moduliths or Microservices try to accommodate scalability in their approach, allowing your code to be designed to be spread across multiple servers from the ground up.

You have a great base somewhere in your head :) to pull from. Start with something small and definitely do it full stack. If you focus on frontend only you will miss backend context. Same thing the other way around. To me, those two things go together.Start small and keep it simple. Let the project guide what you need to learn next. I almost always suggest the often dismissed TODO exercise to start with since you already have some base knowledge.Start small, create an index.html page that has the word ""hello"" on it. This is where I always start after 30+ years of doing this :) Next, and the next small thing, probably the proper html scaffolding. Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.Make TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack.Now for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.Do this with every small project you work on. An address book, an small online store, an invoice payment processing system, inventory management system. The skills you learn from take TODO the whole nine yards will give you the skill you need to build any of these.Also, I have been doing this for over 30+ years and I pretty much only know (often remember) basic syntax.

You can do it without, but ORMs help.Finally, it enables other utility like data transfer object (DTO) where you have to translate between db and front end or remove/clean up objects you need for backend processing but don't necessarily want users to see on the front end.In industry they're pretty common, especially on larger systems. My personal take is it's a lazy route for devs that don't know database stuff, but it does elegantly solve some problems so they have some value.",Xanderlynn5,2025-12-08 01:44:08,2,learnprogramming,t3_1pgr7ow,False,

The advantage of ORMs is that they are agnostic to the actual DB implementation. I can write up an app in Django and it'll (mostly) work just as fine with Sqlite, Postgres, MSSQL or whatever else you might want to hook it up to. There's a lot of other advantages to using a framework like Django, like how it handles sanitization of user input and is an all-in-one solution for front and backend, but that's not exactly relevant to the ORM question.You aren't exactly missing anything vital about ORMs, but you are probably overthinking the question.

That said, you may run into some hiccups if you're not too familiar with Latin>Latin has a very interesting way of generating words: You have an word stem, which usually doesnt change, and then an very big number of possible suffixes that change based on the context in which the word appears.This is arguably not all that interesting on its own; well over 50% of the languages on earth have inflection on nouns. That said, that's a minor gripe. Another minor gripe:>And nouns are a comparatively easy example here. Putting aside the fact that the suffixes also change based on the declension of a word (mostly affected by grammatical gender), Verbs have even more different attributes to them, especially when it comes to the tempus.Case, Class, Gender, and Plurality are all involved in declension. Declension is the act of changing the inflection (grammatical affixes) of a noun. In talking about the different suffixes nouns have based on case, we are inherently talking about declension - not putting it aside.> I am currently trying to learn Latin by inserting the rules of the language into a Java library.Don't know how effective that'll be for learning the language, but as a programming project, it's neat!>In the nominative case, its just ""Servus"", while the genitive case has ""servi"", the dative has ""servo"" and the accusative case has ""servum"" (Cases determine the function of a Noun in the context of a sentence and therefore are extremly important for translations). But then there are also the plural forms, which are ""Servi"", ""servorum"",""servis"" and ""servos"" respectively.If you intended to store things as stems, you might run into issues as there are 5 basic noun classes in Latin ignoring irregulars. ""Servus"" may be class II, but ""Puella"" is class I, and thus declines differently. In order to determine which class a word uses, you need both the nominative, and the genitive forms of the word - you can't always derive all forms from the one stem alone.As for how you could handle this, there's a few options.Least structurally intensive is just feeding the noun constructor an enum of the noun class, followed by the stem, and just switch-casing how the noun declines the stem based on that. Alternatively, make an abstract noun class, and create subclasses of it that each handle a different type of noun.The problem with the above is that it couples your conjugations to the noun classes/subclasses, which isn't very SOLID - bad practice. Preferred option would be to ditch the enums, and create a number of Declension Strategies (See: [The Strategy Design Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy)) you can feed the constructor. This has the benefit of decoupling your declensions from the nouns themselves.Regardless of which of the above do the job, if you want to restrict which nouns get which declension without putting that logic in the noun class itself (again, best practice), you could also implement a Noun Factory or Builder (See: [The Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method) or [Builder](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder)) which can take in the nominative / genitive forms of a noun, determine its class, and create a noun object with the appropriate strategy for you.But that's a whole lot of over engineering, so take it all with a grain of salt. All I recommend is that you read more about Latin morphology before embarking on this, as it'll help you understand what actually has to happen when declining the nouns.",DTux5249,2025-12-05 22:31:29,2,learnprogramming,t3_1pf363w,False,

It can optionally have a parameter that accepts a string array.So these are examples of methods that the C# compiler will ""detect"" as the entry point:```public static void Main(string[] args)public static int Main()``` The ""signature"" of a method is the combination of all the attributes name and argument types of a methodI don't know if Java allows different entry point signatures.The reason why it has as string[] args or returns an int is because programs can be launched with command line parameters (args) that are passed by the OS to the program, even GUI programs.Then, programs are allowed to return a numeric value indicating the status upon exit, where nonzero means an error might have occured, hence the int return type.This is the same in C, C++, Java. The compilers setup the code so that the runtime will call the program entry point. The runtime is the library that does all the setup of allocating resources then transferring execution to your actual code.`new Main` probably has nothing to do with the main method.You are perfectly allowed to create a class named `Main`. It doesn't interfere with the program entry point. So `new Main` was probably just a user-defined class.",rupertavery64,2025-12-08 15:05:21,1,learnprogramming,t3_1phe5vo,False,

My programming journey started with simple projects in electronics, like solving resistor networks that required a target impedance and range of voltage offsets. I often implemented an iterative solver that started with a guesstimate and automatically adjusted itself until the solution was found. I learned a lot about iterative problem solving as well as learning the language. Those programs became utilities that I would use from time to time.Another project of mine was a Monte Carlo simulator to test various strategies for maintenance contracts. I learned a lot about Monte Carlo simulations, event queues, and the distribution of non-normal data. This was a much more ambitious project and never reached a production ready state, but still it was a useful means of analyzing my problem and learning to leverage features of the language I was working using (C++).Whatever you decide to do, you need to write code.

There’s a database where you save, change, fetch, or delete things.If you want a job in the field, you need to be able to build a todo list app. If you want to get paid well, you need to add things like authentication and AWS features to that same “todo list.”First step, learn how to make a basic todo list. After you build it once, try to rebuild it with minimal help.Making a todo list isn’t super easy, but it’s not very hard either.You can watch a one hour tutorial, build a todo list app, write to a database, use something simple like SQLite, and learn most of the core ideas.After that, think about what else the todo list needs. It needs authentication so other people can’t see your data. You need to host it somewhere like Vercel so you can access it online. You’ll probably need a backend, and to host that backend you can use something like Render’s free tier. Now you learn how to deploy the app to two services and connect them.While deploying, you’ll meet the great enemy: CORS errors. You’ll freak out, maybe punch a wall, but you’ll figure it out.Now you have a todo list, two codebases, deployed on two services, talking to each other, with auth in place.What’s next?Maybe fetch weather data and show it on the home screen.

ns5f2xp,"This is solid advice.To basically reiterate, depending on where you’re at in your learning, take a staggered approach. At least for me it helps me to understand better.Like if you’re just starting to learn JavaScript, start with a bare naked project and get the script to say something. A simple hello world. Then build it up to be a simple, SIMPLE calculator. All just in the terminal, no ui. Then when you’re comfortable with JavaScript itself and getting things to pop up on the terminal, then you’re ready to start learning how to build a project from scratch.Take your script you made, and try and slap a React ui on top of it, moving your logic to the backend to get practice with full-stack development (if that’s a goal of yours). This is the important stepping away from the tutorial part. This is where you make a decision to NOT follow a tutorial and instead look at documentation and examples to understand what is going on in these, in this instance, React applications. Every engineer uses references. It’s okay to not know things. But the goal is to understand the process, not copying and pasting to create a finished product as fast as you can to feel impressive. I struggled with that part of the mental frame when I first started. Overall, just pick an IDE (vscode or IntelliJ community edition, whatever floats your boat), create a file, and start practicing. Don’t overthink the process. There is no fast path to learning, it’s at your own pace.

This is the fun part, make a game or a GUI application, now there are a few libraries to help you likea. Pygame/turtle for python, draw basic shapes and include textures to make full games from scratchb. Monogame for C# like pygame but for C#c. LWJGL for Java, also like pygame but for Javad.

You have to find a balance, it's okay to experiment and learn niche things in depth, but you want there to be an eventual payoff if possible. For example, learning Rust or Elixir is a good investment of your time, and you'll naturally develop a network to draw from if you want to start a company or join one, but something like Common Lisp has a low probability of a payoff even if it's more fun (yes, I'm bitter). I followed my interest and got a very good career out of it, but I've also seen what happens when people optimize purely for skill.

This is where I always start after 30+ years of doing this :) Next, add the next small thing, probably the proper html scaffolding. Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.Make TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack. Fill in the rest of the REST/CRUD stuff.Now for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.Do this with every small project you work on.

It doesn’t have to be original or impressive, it just has to be real enough that you care whether it works.Also, I wouldn’t rely on classmates for inspiration.

nsokmb2,"It is a complex web of reasons and I am probably not the best person to explain it but here are some things off the top that may explain the phenomenon.I know people who have attempted startups in India. By far the biggest roadblock to their growth, according to them, is the small addressable market. Despite its huge population, India has a relatively small number of people with enough disposable income for startups to feed on. This means a startup has a limited domestic ramp up before they must try to find foreign markets.Second, India doesn’t have the volume of original IP including, but not limited to, university research. You cannot exploit ideas you don’t have to become a tech giant.Third, the policy atmosphere and capital markets in India don’t really compare to the best countries. So, many companies move elsewhere once their requirements cannot be met in India. InMobi, one of the largest mobile ad serving companies in Asia ($1B), was started in India but moved HQ to Singapore.Many companies were sold off by founders as they no longer wished to continue. Walmart bought Flipkart, an Amazon competitor, for $16B from founders who wanted to exit.There are several companies that started of great, became household names, but were then unable to keep their momentum. PayTM ($10B), at one time, was backed by SoftBank, Alibaba group and Berkshire Hathaway who all exited.Finally, while India produces a high volume of CS people, the quality is very uneven and many of the best choose to immigrate (to the US till recently but also elsewhere).

Sometime you have to update a button on an app and it takes you a hour and then there’s nothing else to do for the day. Other times that button takes you multiple days to figure out.

I've noticed developers in reddit want to make it seem like SW is more complicated than it actually is. If you are working in a corporate environment creating business applications, it's a relatively primitive job. Maintainability over over-optimization. I've been working for years on business applications using .net and haven't had the need to do anything with algorithms really, besides knowing when to use what data structures and using built in libraries. Working in cloud you have enough resources not to worry about it. Infrastructure and system design is the biggest challenge, not the coding part. Majority of people work on business apps which essentially are CRUD apps with some business logic. Just write maintainable code and simple code. Over optimizers make the codebase a total mess which most developers will struggle to maintain. When working in corporate - KISS.I've forgotten many algorithms since university. If I have time to prepare, it's not an issue to brush up on it, but, as said, 99% of the time, it's not needed.

When other teams give you work, give it a priority level with regards to existing work.

Sometimes the senior devs are swamped, but the juniors don't have enough work. Seniors should help refine and break down tasks so that a junior can handle them, and juniors should show initiative by taking on unfamiliar tasks and trying to learn while doing.At least in my company, if you are up at 3am fixing an issue no one expects you to be at a 9am meeting. Not to mention that if someone on my team was up at 3am, we'd make it a high priority to make sure it never happens again.Feeling peessure to constantly improve is natural when you're a junior and want to get promoted, but yeah it turns toxic when stack ranking is involved and you know that someone around you will get a PIP.When it becomes too much, you need to tell your manager your concerns during a regularly scheduled 1:1.

Software Engineering in general is going through a lot and what needed an entire team of Engineers and Juniors can now be established by a couple of caffeinated Senior Engineers with AI tools. There is barely any real use for Juniors unless paying them like crap and treating them like cheap labor.

It wasn't until I found various subreddits that I realized what was going on at actual tech companies and how different our experiences were over the years.I was even leading teams of 20 SWEs, have my name on patents, and responsible for all software aspects of the medical device. I was working with interdisciplinary teams and all that good stuff. The problem was I was learning learning one way to do things and that way was not how modern software was created. It was old school 90's style engineering company with managers that have been there since the 80's and 90s doing things that exact same way.It was top down management where they want engineers that just do what they were told and think minimally for themselves.. The company had a lot of lifers that got a job there as a new grad and just never left. If you were not a lifer then you were early in your career and was easy to take advantage of. There were very few middle career engineers with multiple jobs under there belt at the company.Once I saw the light I started telling every new grad hires on the down low that they should stay for a year or 2 and learn what they can. After that leave and get a job at another company that is more tech focused. This company would talk about how they are growing by hiring 90 new engineers in the last year, but they don't tell you they lost 80 engineers over the course of the year so it was a net gain of 10 engineers.Take charge of your own career and don't expect any company to manage it for you in a way that's best for you and not the company.",diablo1128,2025-12-08 21:52:10,16,cscareerquestions,t3_1pholi8,False,

Michael, a business manager, says that he was afraid of change until he heard an allegorical story, which he proceeds to tell.> > In the story, two mice and two ""littlepeople"" – people the size of mice – live in a maze. The mice, named Sniff and Scurry, are simpleminded and instinctive; they run the same path every day, eating cheese when they find it, but are always ready to move on. The littlepeople, Hem and Haw, search for a special kind of Cheese that makes them happy and fulfilled by keeping track of where they have found it before. All four discover a spot where their favorite cheese is regularly available, called Cheese Station C. The mice continue to run the entire maze each day while the littlepeople stop exploring and settle at Cheese Station C.> > One day the supply at Cheese Station C is exhausted. The mice accept that there is no more cheese and continue their running path. The littlepeople sit at the station confused and upset. Hem protests that there ought to be Cheese, and Haw wonders where the mice have gone. Meanwhile, the mice find a new supply of cheese at Cheese Station N. The littlepeople remain at Cheese Station C for several days, growing frustrated and hungry. Eventually Haw accepts that running the maze is the only way he will ever have Cheese again, faces his fear of moving on, and leaves Hem behind.> > Haw finds crumbs of Cheese scattered around the maze and some other Cheese Stations that are already depleted. He returns to Cheese Station C and tells Hem there is other Cheese, but Hem refuses to budge. Haw continues exploring, writing observations about his journey on the walls of the maze, until he arrives at Cheese Station N which is stocked with all kinds of Cheese.> > Haw reflects on the lessons he has learned and hopes that Hem will finally let go of his doubts. On the wall of Cheese Station N, he writes several lessons that change is inevitable and keeping up with it is the only way to continue having Cheese. Cautious from past experience, Haw inspects Cheese Station N daily and explores different parts of the maze regularly to prevent complacency. Hearing movement in the maze one day, Haw realizes someone is approaching the station and hopes it is his friend Hem.> > After Michael finishes the story, the classmates agree to meet again before dinner and discuss it.

I never went to a bar when I was in college, so I didn’t have much use for cheap Jeopardy-like information that I was learning.In my five years of university, I think I actually enjoyed maybe two or three classes. The coolest one was data science, where we used algorithms in Python like k-nearest neighbor to classify clusters of data and iteratively displayed the algorithm converging, which was a pretty neat and beautiful display of mathematics.But the other stuff was like memorizing the five-state diagram of a CPU round-robin task priority queue, and how tasks were transferred from cache memory into RAM and vice versa. Not my cup of tea, and I forgot the information quickly after the test.One class on RISC-V assembly was neat—making a little library to read and write from a text file by meticulously setting up the assembly memory registers. but all in all it was a pretty painful experience and until I get a job the in the field I cannot really recommended it.

nsu7ckx,"I have a PhD in math, from a US R1 that did not distinguish between pure and applied. My cohort has had a very wide range of outcomes, from people getting big tech/FAANG research jobs to people adjuncting at the local community college and living a low-key life. (I find myself drifting towards the latter, now that I'm closer to 40 than 30 and realize that I'll never want kids or a house in the 'burbs.)The people with the tech research jobs actively sought that out during their PhDs. They found advisors in other departments working on ML, and attended ML seminars, helped run ML workshops, did tech internships, etc. There was a time when generic math/physics/etc PhDs got hired on to these jobs, but Covid slammed that door shut if you weren't actively keeping it open... nowadays, given the market, even getting hired as an SWE or data scientist right out of grad school isn't easy. Being a smart guy/gal who used Sage for your number theory project or MATLAB for your CFD project doesn't really cut it any more.The average time to completion in my program was 6 years. I knew a few people who finished in 4, and a few who stayed for 9-10, but most people got out in 5-7. I was on track to be a 5, until I got scooped, and I ended up making it out in 7. You said it was a foreign PhD program and these tend to be shorter because they expect you to already have an MS coming in and start working on research immediately, but it still raises an eyebrow that you're already 28 and penciling in being out by 32-33. (Mid-30s isn't old by any means, but it is just old enough that you will look around and see a lot of your friends having kids and buying houses, so if you're prone to comparing yourself with people that could gnaw at you.)So I think my gut reaction is this isn't a bad idea, but at least my experience has been that a STEM PhD is not a golden ticket to a high paying tech job any more. You will want to align yourself with that from day one of school if that's your goal. If you drift into doing a pure math or even classical applied math (e.g. CFD, PDEs) thesis, it might not get you where you want to go.edit: sorry, I said ""foreign"" but you're not even from the US, so from your perspective it's not foreign at all!

Agents should catch their own mistakes, pass tests, use tools, etc.",Shwayne,2025-12-03 15:43:30,2,cscareerquestions,t1_ns2wiho,False,

ns31pxj,"Yeah, too many people here seem to be so anti-AI to the point that they are just letting themselves get left behind. Certainly, it's not a perfect tool and should absolutely be used with caution, especially for production code.But I've found myself being more productive now. There was definitely some learning curve and a bit of time needed to fine tune what worked for me but it's working well for me so far.",Illustrious-Pound266,2025-12-03 15:58:05,2,cscareerquestions,t1_ns2yna9,False,
