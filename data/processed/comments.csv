nzwk9gw,"100% agree but in the past 6 months AI agents have really changed how my team and I work.As I was writing the stuff below I realized it became too long... so here's a summary.TLDR; going from first using agents to improve our data pipelines and stack, to eventually creating a more self-service system where our data consumers use AI agents to interact with the data. For some context, I'm leading the DE team of 4-5 people (1 mid/senior, 1 junior, 2-3 interns) at a company where our end product is predictions for highly specialized industries (e.g. renewables, transportation).At first it started with using our data platform's MCP with cursor to just lookup documentation, then I started asking cursor to read our data pipelines and query the dwh directly to find the specific part of a query or script that was causing some issue.But in the past couple months, after creating some extensive agent rules/instructions documentations as well as creating a md file for each pipeline that contains some business context, I have been able to fully rely on cursor to build pipelines or make major changes.A recent example is that I spent \~1 hour creating a details requirements document that I gave as the prompt, the agent make changes to \~10 files (mostly sql models and some yml configs and a python ingestion script). About 3-4 hours of back and forth with the agents to make some adjustments, update documentation, and runs tests and validation. The entire process was done in a single workday, whereas normally this would've been 2-3 days of work.Its not always about ""saving"" time for me but rather its about doing things the ""better"" way - a clear example of this is having the agents create/update documentation, build/run tests, perform adhoc validations, etc. which translates into time saving in the futureI know what I've said above is not related to ""AI on top of broken data stack"", but the reason why I'm talking about how AI is helping data engineers is because I think it that is the sole reason/contributor to speeding up the process of fixing and improving our data stack.By fully utilizing the combination of cursor, mcp integrations, internal rules/instructions/context documents, and access to query our data warehouse, we were able to ""slap AI on top of our data"" as in:\- other teams (i.e. data science, software engineering, product, etc.) to also close our data engineering repos and have conversations with cursor to ask it about the logic behind data models (e.g. does table\_xyz contain data from source\_abc? how often does table\_xyz get updated? what is the calculation method for kpi abc?)\- integration of an AI Slackbot (provided by our data platform provider) that queries our dwh and returns insights - as a result, we have seen people in data science, sales, execs, etc. move away from using dashboards and instead asking the slackbot directly inside threads things like ""what was our prediction accuracy last week?"" ""how did model A perform vs model B last year?""I think this only became possible because we were able to quickly (within 2-3 months) clean up our data pipelines and data models, create a lot of documentation and context for AI to utilize, and break down the barrier between data consumers and the data itself - this way as the data engineering team, we are no longer a bottleneck and things have finally trending towards the ""self-service"" utopia we've always dreamt about.",uncertainschrodinger,2026-01-16 11:44:01,4,dataengineering,t3_1qebb1m,False,

They have been talking about the graph approach for a while, but barriers are how your data is organized/tagged as it's less effective the fewer relationships you have. That's not easy to establish depending on what your metadata looks like. Also massive graph dbs tend to not be that performant. You can still get pretty good results with them, especially for document search use cases or something like that. But there are also people talking about how tensor based LLMs are limited and not going to get us to the promised land and the next step might be difusion models or something else.

o0hrah2,"I'm in a team that built everything on AWS services, with similar amounts of incoming data.It was fine at first. As long as everything was simple with a single region and incoming product, and a few people had been working on it and had direct experience with how everything was done, then the 'quirks' were kept to a minimum and everyone knew them.Then as new team members got onboarded things got harder. People had to be taught all the quirks of which role to use when creating a glue job vs an interactive notebook, they had to be shown the magic command boilerplate to get glue catalog and iceberg tables working, they needed to know the bucket that was set up for output for Athena queries. With more people working not everyone could be across everyone else's work, so people weren't familiar with how various custom jobs and scripts had been made, and because each job was its own mini vertical stack there was a lot of repeated components in infrastructure, policies, ci/cd scripts.As new use cases came on that didn't fit the mould new ways of doing things had to be added. Kinesis and firehose come in, airflow orchestration gets tasked for some small transforms while others go to glue jobs. Someone wants a warehouse/database to query, so redshift is added. Exports to third party processors are needed as are imports, so more buckets, more permissions. API ingestions are needed so in come lambda functions, with each one coded and deployed differently because nobody can see what everyone else is doing.Then finally users need access to data, and the team just isn't set up for it. There is no central catalog with everything, it is spread out across half a dozen services, and the only way to know where anything is or goes is to dig through the code. That 'worked' for the DE team, since they were the ones doing the digging, but there was no effective way to give access to everything. Every request for data took days or weeks to finalise, and often required more pipelines to move it to where it could be accessed.We're moving to Databricks soon. It gives a unified UI for DE and other teams to access the data, you get sql endpoints, you can run basic compute on single-node 'clusters', it has orchestration built in, it gives you a somewhat easier way to manage permissions, and it works for both running your own compute and giving data access. Instead of a mishmash of technologies that don't make a unified platform, you get a consistent experience.You'll just have to pay extra since it is doing a good portion of that unification work for you.If you had a hundred DE type roles it might be more cost effective to stick with base aws services, and have a dedicated team focused on dx, standards, and productivity, to cut out the managed compute cost.

o0hwxhq,"I am in the Data Science/MLOps, but tend to work with Data Engineers. Take my opinion with some level of salt. I work on the Databricks platform full time. I have experience with spark, orchestration, A.I. Agents, etc. Databricks can do everything you listed. It is not the best in each category. Airflow is a superior orchestration tool than Databricks Workflows, for example. However Databricks provides tools in all categories that are more than good enough.I find myself surprised how easy most things are. I usually do a POC with a G.U.I. first. Then reimplement with code, checking against the G.U.I. POC as I go. There is a G.U I. for Databricks Workflows and A.I. Agents. In general, everything seems to be as easy as possible, with good default settings. The advantage of having good enough tools in broad categories that all integrate well with each other makes life easy.Measured against AWS, Databricks is more expensive. Your company can either pay more for compute ( go with Databricks) or pay more to expand the team with specialized people (AWS). Expensive compute is cheaper than expensive specialists.Plus Databricks is moving to everything runs on serverless. In practice, I would say 80% to 90% of prod code runs on serverless. I see this improving with time.Closing remark. Databricks is a thought leader. They have made many open source software that everything else is compared to. (Spark, MLflow, DeltaLake,...). Databricks competitors run Databricks open source software. Agent bricks hosts 20+ LLMs out of the box.

We used all of the technologies you listed except data tone and only a bit of lake formation. Then we wanted to have a business facing data catalogue with lineage and there wasn’t much available in AWS. As of 2026 I would argue that is still the case. For data catalogue we used OpenMetadata. For hosting we used EKS btw.Long story short it takes a lot of development effort to put all of these technologies together and to maintain it. It works well once done and it is scalable. But if I would do it again I would use Databricks in 2026. Gets you started quickly. Downside will be cost as you have to pay for DBUs on top off AWS cost. Arguably you would need less data developers which could pay for the additional cost. I know this is a bit off a sticking point nobody wants to think about. But if you plan to use your devs to build the AWS solution then you already covered the dev cost. If you go with Databricks you may need less data devs, assuming that some part of their time is currently used for infrastructure work. If the new AWS architecture would need more devs than the argument would be that Databricks would allow you to operate with the current number of devs.If you decide to go with databricks use an open source table format like iceberg to reduce vendor locking.

Best-practice in terms of this kind of thing is to know the trade-offs), implement observability from day 1 (that can be writing logs and checking them daily in cloudwatch at the start).Note that MANY of your trade-offs and architectural decisions will depend on what kind of requirements are required downstream. In fact, the very first thing you need to map is who are the data consumers and what are their needs - mind you that more often than not the end-users have very vague requirements (it is often a big part of the job to translate vague business requirements into technical choices - also, often what they want is different than what they need). If applicable to your case: also talk to upstream stakeholders (feks, in my company, the data is generated by services written by developers, so I have to sync with them to understand what is doable or not in terms of data serving/latency)EDIT: also, if you are not super familiar with AWS, dont underestimate how much time you'll spend implementing things there :D(I'm in a similar position, where I wear the architect, tech lead and engineer hat at the same time - and oh, Iam also brazilian ;) )",maxbranor,2026-01-16 21:49:02,20,dataengineering,t3_1qeoqfo,False,

The way you send a query, read results, execute statements, etc, then can be the same no matter which database you are using. This API layer doesn't standardize the query languages you need to use; you still need to send valid SQL commands for the target database, but the code you use to send those queries doesn't need to be specific to the target database.The difference between ODBC and JDBC is that ODBC is a C-style API and the drivers are platform-specific. IE you always to build a Linux version and a separate Windows version. And some ODBC drivers are only available on Windows (where ODBC originated).JDBC is specific to Java (and other JVM languages like Scala), but a single pure Java (type 4) driver can be used across platforms.In data engineering JDBC and ODBC are the default, legacy connectors to get to data from various systems. Both suffer from their heritage as drivers for client/server database systems, and so typically will use a single TCP/IP connection to send queries and read results. In big data engineering this can be a bottleneck, and so things like native Spark connectors have been built for more scalable data connections to big data systems.",dbrownems,2026-01-21 16:43:37,1,dataengineering,t3_1qdmier,False,

It's great.Where I work I use the MySQL v8 ODBC in a Windows server running MSSQL in prod, and push tables across the network truncate/load in a remote staging tables of a MySQL server (that the Wan IP addresses & ports are fixed and whitelisted for security). Once the load is completed, a stored proc is called remotely to signal the MySQL to process those staging tables.It's an annoying process though, I would rather create flat files, push them somewhere, and an event triggered at the remote end (like a datalake container/folder) processes them.

Your Python service pulls data from the carpark API and publishes events as they arrive. From there, you usually want some kind of streaming or messaging layer to decouple ingestion from processing, so bursts or failures don’t break everything. Next comes processing, where you clean the data, handle duplicates or late events, and compute whatever metrics you care about (occupancy, availability trends, etc.). This can be done in near-real-time or small micro-batches depending on complexity. The processed output then lands in a store that’s optimized for querying or visualization, which your frontend reads from. The key ideas to focus on early are idempotency, schema consistency, and what “real time” actually means for your use case (seconds vs minutes).

nzw1ach,"You’re absolutely right to be wary of random sampling—if you care about rare events, long tails, or uncommon categories, sampling can miss them entirely. Chunking with pandas is a solid approach for memory management, but you do have to be careful: some operations just don’t make sense chunk-by-chunk.Chunking is great for row-wise, stateless preprocessing (cleanup, type conversion, basic feature engineering). But for anything that needs a full view of the data—global normalization, deduplication, calculating rare category frequencies, finding global min/max—you’ll either need multiple passes or a clever accumulation/aggregation step.A typical workflow for your scenario:- First pass: Scan over chunks to gather global stats (means, stds, value counts, rare category thresholds).- Second pass: Use those stats to transform the data in chunks. Outlier detection, normalization, etc. can be done chunked, but with knowledge of global parameters.- Save intermediate files as Parquet if possible, for speed and compression.- Tools: Dask and Polars both handle these kinds of workflows better than vanilla pandas, especially Polars for very fast I/O and multi-threading.- For Colab: keep an eye on disk (mount Google Drive if needed), and be ready to restart if you hit session limits.If you ever need to empower less technical folks to safely interact with this data (without risking direct DB access), there are platforms nowadays that let you build internal apps over your datasets via drag-and-drop, or even AI chat interfaces.

At 30M rows, this almost always triggers an OOM (Out of Memory) crash in environments like Colab.​Serialization Overhead: Converting DuckDB’s internal format to Pandas and then to a model-ready format creates unnecessary CPU work and memory duplication.​Moving to Polars solved this because it feels like it was built for the 'Model' part of 'Data Science.' Since it uses the Apache Arrow memory format, it integrates seamlessly with XGBoost, LightGBM, and Scikit-Learn with zero-copy potential meaning the model can often read the data directly without doubling the RAM usage.​The Lazy API and Streaming mode let me handle the full 30M-row feature engineering pipeline with way more stability.

I think you need to talk about having such a stable test environment with the engineering management, in my experience it was mostly called ""staging"". It's not supposed to be a copy of ""production"", and it's better if it is not for information security, but it should be a good simulation of production cases to test the code edge cases (as I described above).In our case, our dev environment is our local laptops. We have hand crafted test files crafted to represent the different cases, and we are able to run full flows locally with either our tools running locally or mocking. Local allows to iterate much faster than if you have to deploy and rely on non-local tools. The unit tests and full flow tests are automated to be able to run in CICD or on request on PRs if they are too slow for systematic run.

Or maybe the upstream system just writes all pending domain objects to s3 every 5-15 minutes. * And the domain object is locked down with a data contract. This contract is kept in version control, and both the source & target teams can use it to validate all data being sent & received.

We use either JSON (easy to edit manually) or AVRO (Kafka source), depending on the source of the flow we are testing. If the test flow's source is a table, the source file is turned into the table format we use first by the test logic. Usually, data comes from staging since we already have representative but fake data there that is safe to keep in Git. It is potentially manually modified to add some cases that we need to test.> Also, just to confirm my understanding around environments: staging is what you always reference in test (and possibly dev, depending on your answer above), correct? 1. When a team member submits a PR, it is required for them to prove that their change works in staging, typically sharing a successful flow run with the different run modes (normal scheduled run, backfill, or whatever specific parameter). That's really the minimum that should be expected for any change affecting flows. 2. For any function that does not rely on integration with external tools, we require the very classic unit tests. Those take a few ms each, so they are always triggered in our CI tool whenever a commit is pushed.3. A bit more recently, we have been adding ""local flow tests"" that can be run locally on our laptop and in the CI tool. This means we can validate that the flow logic works locally, and we are able to use a local debugger, which is pretty amazing for ETL work. We can also run it on request with a comment during the PR review; the results are written in the commit status on Github. We don't run those automatically at every commit push because they have quite some overhead to set up a local flow environment (especially Spark's overhead); they take something like 30 to 90 s for each flow. This was a lot of work to create, but it is now extremely valuable. > If that’s the case, then in theory our “test” environment should fail, and alert us, whenever there’s a schema change that isn’t properly communicated. Is that the right way to think about it?For the tests to fail due to a schema change, the test data needs to have changed accordingly. For local tests, your team controls the test data, so it cannot have changed if you didn't know. Where it should fail is during the staging run, if the upstream team has correctly updated the data they are responsible for in staging and actually ran their change in staging. So, it still relies on the upstream team doing its job properly, which requires engineering management to enforce it if they are not doing it by themselves.If it failed in staging, you can check how the data changed and modify your local test data to cover the new situation. But, you shouldn't have to find it by yourself like this; the chances to miss the changes even if it is in staging are still too high, for example, if it only affects a small subset of records.So again, the most important solution is that there should be a mandatory communication channel for them to announce the change and collect the confirmation of the downstream teams. At minimum, something like a Slack message where downstream teams are pinged. With this information you can at minimum make sure your staging run goes through the change. If you have a local test, you can then directly modify your local test data and comfortably check on your laptop with a debugger what the consequence is for your flow. Ideally, there is the data contract system mentioned by others. Every schema is versioned in Git; it serves as the reference for every dependent project, and any change needs to be approved by the downstream teams in the PR. But I think very few companies have this level of maturity; even in my current company, where it is already very high considering the quality of testing I have described above, it is only partially implemented.> - Upstream Staging -> Our Dev/Test> - Upstream Prod -> Our ProdThe staging environment is supposed to be shared by all teams that have dependencies, so the integration of the different projects can be tested just like in production, except the data is a simulation. The only difference in terms of code is that staging may have the newer version of the code that is being tested. So it should be like this:- Staging environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projects- Production environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projectsLocal testing is a separate environment that is defined in your Git repositories, so you wouldn't expect the upstream team to modify it, just like you wouldn't expect them to change the code you own. - Local test environment (only your teams): your test data (possibly based on staging upstream data) -> Your project -> your data- Staging environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projects- Production environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projectsYour company could have another shared testing environment before staging. I can imagine a ""testing"" environment being for unstable testing; expect things to break regularly because teams will test early versions, and ""staging"" for stable testing; things should not break too much so you can test in production-like conditions. In our case, our local/staging/production is covering what we need, so I wouldn't see the point of having a 4th environment.",sib_n,2026-01-22 01:23:34,1,dataengineering,t1_o0vr660,False,
o0y27rz,"> Doesn't the contract just ensure that what is published needs to match the agreed upon rules? Yes AND it means there's no excuse for that: the upstream system can test against these rules, the downstream can validate, there is a *contract*, so the upstream system *owns* the problem. > If the upstream team changes the data contract AND adjusts their workflow to comply with that contract it doesn't really change the fact that it breaks my downstream pipeline.Except your team should also be an approver on the contract - it'll be in git. So that change shouldn't go to production until you've written, tested, and deployed the code that's ready to support that version of the contract.> Do multiple versions of the actual data actually get published based on old/new contracts?Not that I've seen. What I generally see is that the consumer can support multiple versions of the contract.

ETL Pipeline: Ingest data from public APIs (maybe weather, finance, or social media), clean and transform it, and store it in a cloud database. Visualize results or build a simple dashboard to display insights.2. Data Warehouse Project: Set up a mini data warehouse using open source tools (like PostgreSQL, DuckDB, or even cloud warehouses if allowed by your school). Populate it with multiple sources and practice schema design, partitioning, and basic analytics queries.3. Batch vs Stream: Compare batch ETL (e.g., with Airflow or Prefect) and simple streaming (Kafka or just a basic pub/sub) on a dataset. Even if you use sample scripts, explaining the trade-offs is valuable.4. End-to-End Analytics: Choose a topic (like campus resource usage or student performance if you can get anonymized data), gather, clean, and enrich the data, and display it in a lightweight front-end. This gives you a taste of the full stack.Don’t worry about building something massive; depth of understanding matters more than shiny complexity.

o04q1vh,"I came into data in a similar way, coming from finance directly to lead a data team with limited technical knowledge other than decent sql. I have also been involved with several data warehouse builds in my career. You are thinking about it in the right way as this stuff is always a series of tradeoffs. What does feature X do for us, how long will it take and what value does it provide?It seems like you are vague on requirements, which is the norm, so I would focus on that as it will inform what you build (i.e. you will be rebuilding and reloading if you miss a bunch of stuff). Start with what you have today and come up with a list of columns and the concepts they related to as a starting point. I would also get with whoever does the budget modeling / FP&A work for the company as they know the KPIs and drivers of the business, which you will have to align to. At the end you should have a list of columns or metrics with a domain and column (e.g. domain is customer and columns for account number, name, address, etc).Then start with that as you talk to other stakeholders. A good meeting might involve say someone from marketing who knows the views they want to see, a data analyst who might know what columns/calculations are involved in producing that view and then you and your DA can bump that off against your model. It's easier to ask them for what's missing rather than come to them with a blank sheet of paper. Also get a sign off from the department because they will inevitably come back with 20 more requests on the week you drop the finished product. The DA should be able to work from that artifact.The data model is important because ideally you want one data source that feeds 80% or more of your data requests. This ensures that data is consistent across all reporting and dashboards as it uses the same core data and calculations. If there is an error in a calculation, you can change it in one place and it propagates across all the dependencies. If you build custom data models for each dashboard or request, then you can have inconsistencies where the developer used the wrong formula, or when you need to make a change you have to find it and change it dozens to hundreds of times.In terms of important things I would say requirements is first (though you can often do this incrementally), then figuring out your infrastructure. Like what is your approach to building pipelines and does it provide velocity to develop, is it maintainable, observable, etc. Does your data platform align well with the likely use cases you know about? You sort of need this initial planning in place to get going, but afterward you can build incrementally as MVPs or by data subject to show off progress.You need to balance delivering value and insight to the business with the necessary things to support a robust platform. Things like automations should be considered, but it's a question of prioritization. How much time does the automation save vs time to build right now? Can we defer it without major consequences? Which ones are the priority? Can we produce demoable work each sprint or quarter to show progress, and better if the platform can be partially used to deliver value ahead of being fully fleshed out.\-sorry for the essay.",Gators1992,2026-01-17 16:44:12,1,dataengineering,t3_1qe02ol,False,

A lot of people who get bored in senior analyst roles feel that same shift, less enjoyment from “telling the story” and more from building the systems and models that make everything work. If you enjoy data modeling, Python, and building tools that reduce friction for others, that’s already a big piece of modern DE work. Many DE roles today are less about pure infra and more about enabling analytics at scale, which fits your background well. You’re not starting from zero, you’re just moving closer to the plumbing. On the ITIL / process side yes, it’s more structured, and that can be frustrating at first. The upside is fewer fire drills and clearer ownership the downside is slower change and more ceremony. People coming from “fast and loose” teams usually struggle with pace more than the work itself, but most adapt once they see the stability benefits. As for frustrations, you’ve already named most of them unclear requirements, data quality issues, tribal knowledge, and legacy decisions you inherit.

Airflow and DBT are free and you can use a local RDBMS instead of a cloud DW for a project to teach you ETL concepts and data orchestration, warehousing, modeling.Get good at one stack and apply for jobs that use those.

o08ykmb,Man I feel your pain. The situation you described sounds eerily similar to what I walked into at my current job a couple of years back. We had this sprawling CRM system that had been customized over the years by like 5 different consultants none of whom seemed to talk to each other. Marketing was using one set of IDs for customers sales had another and finance was just throwing their hands up in the air. Trying to get a single reliable customer view was a nightmare. We spent weeks just trying to map out the different entities and how they related to each other. It felt like unraveling a giant knotted ball of yarn. And then of course once we thought we had it figured out someone would drop a bomb like Oh yeah that table We stopped using that three years ago but nobody told anyone. The worst part was the constant requests for data pulls. Sales would want a list of customers with X Y and Z marketing needed a segment with A B and C and the data team was stuck writing custom SQL queries all day long. It was completely unsustainable and we never got to work on anything strategic. What finally saved us was this virtual data platform we implemented. The thing that impressed us most was its ability to automatically discover all these hidden relationships between entities that would have taken us weeks to untangle manually. The AI engine identified and resolved data quality issues too duplicate entries mismatched data types the whole nine yards. We didnt have to move or duplicate any data either which was a huge plus for security and compliance. Then once the data was unified we started building no-code ETL processes to push cleansed data to the different systems and to our data warehouse. That part really freed up our data team. Instead of constantly fulfilling ad-hoc requests we could focus on building actual data products and analytics. Seriously the reduction in headaches alone was worth the cost. I know it sounds like Im selling you something here and I kinda am. The company that makes the platform has a referral program and yeah Id get a kickback if you ended up using them.

o0ky3so,"Yeah, this is a really normal point of confusion when you move from DA work into ingestion side DE. The big mindset shift is that schemas tell you how tables relate, but they don’t tell you how data changes. Streams only show what Snowflake sees as new or updated rows since the last run, so if the source system quietly edits an old record, you’ll never see that unless you deliberately go back and reprocess it. That’s why a lot of pipelines use a lookback window (reloading the last N days every run) or just full refresh smaller tables. If the source doesn’t give you a reliable “last updated” field or CDC feed, you kind of have to assume old data can change and design around that. For tables without dates, truncating by time doesn’t really make sense. Those usually get merged by a stable business key, or fully rebuilt if they’re small enough. The “forked” tables usually follow the lifecycle of the parent record, not the ingestion date. In general, when you’re trying to understand ingestion, I’d ask “how does this data change in the source system?” rather than “how do these tables join.” Once you answer that, the truncate vs merge decisions start to feel a lot more obvious",joins_and_coffee,2026-01-20 00:54:28,3,dataengineering,t3_1qgyrpt,False,

o01r9u7,"I don’t think you’re wrong to be frustrated, and you’re definitely not the only one who’s felt this with Fabric. From the outside it looks less like “networking is unimportant” and more like Fabric being designed as a very opinionated SaaS first, and an Azure-native platform second. MPEs feel awkward because they’re basically abstracting VNET concepts into something Fabric can control end to end. That gives Microsoft tighter isolation, simpler UX for less technical users, and easier multi-tenant guarantees, but it also means every new resource type needs explicit support. That doesn’t scale well for power users who expect networking to just work like it does in Synapse or Databricks. The slow rollout of MPE types is probably a mix of security review, product prioritization, and yes, commercial incentives. Fabric clearly pushes “bring data into OneLake” patterns first, and anything that bypasses that path feels like a second-class citizen. Whether that’s intentional cost pressure or just product focus, the effect is the same for customers. I don’t think it’s a lack of technical capability so much as Fabric still deciding who it’s really for. Right now it feels optimized for managed ingestion and analytics inside the ecosystem, not for complex private networking scenarios. Until that changes, Fabric is hard to recommend as a full replacement for Synapse/Databricks if deep network control is a requirement.

Obviously a PITA to do this if you had 100s of tables, but since you only have two tables, dead easy. In theory you could query the metadata directly to get this programmatically. It's one of the sys views, but I never remember which.Other than checking table counts, I guess the important question is how is the server migration being performed? If it's a backup of the old DBs being restored onto the new server, then this is a pretty bombproof approach, so long as:- writes to the DB have been completely stopped first (e.g. put DB into read only mode first)- the backup is run with the checksum optionSo in this case, I'd focus more on making sure the process for the migration has been thought out fully - then you don't have a lot of validation to do. Otherwise you're just validating that a widely used quarter-century-old enterprise RDBMS doesn't have a certain type of seriously fundamental bug.If the data migration is happening via some bespoke approach then you do need to validate further. But you first need to ask why they're not doing the more obvious simple backup/restore. For further validation, you really need to take the hit on slow scan queries and make sure the time needed for that is built into the migration plan.Gathering stats is the right approach but I'd focus on sum() of numerical columns that mean something to the business (currency values, quantities, durations, etc). Just sum the whole table with no group by. It doesn't have to be a useful KPI /metric that way, it's just a number that would be very sensitive to anything going wrong in the migration.

This of course won't fly for many leet code problems, and some platforms don't even allow one to use many functional languages and set hard time requirements for execution time of the solutions. Parallelism and code cleanliness is given no thought. You can write all shit code with single letter variable names mutating shit everywhere, and it will accept your solution more likely than a very clean functional solution, that is trivially parallelizable and would scale (if ever needed).Looking at LC mastery mostly selects for people, who have ground that stuff hard and memorized that stuff (which won't be of too much use on the job for actual real world problems) or people, who think that this kind of procedural mutating way of programming and the typically associated languages are the end all be all, and have limited experience with other things.I much prefer advent of code (AoC) style puzzles, where you can use any language you want, and you just need a number as the solution.I feel like solving AoC puzzles has improved my ability to solve problems the functional way, even, if they at first seem to not lend themselves well to the functional paradigm. I found some pretty neat functional solutions at times. Like for example using bitboards represented by numbers as an underlying data structure and boosting performance of my previously too slow solution by a factor of more than 1000. I had to sometimes write functional versions of well known procedural algorithms. Things like A-star algorithm and Dijkstra algorithm, depth-first-search, breadth-first search.

It is a great backup tool on one hand, and on the other hand it should encourage you to play around, to experiment, to try and break things because it always gives you a fallback.To give you *some* credit, maybe you used the wrong resources to learn. If a resource doesn't force you to do the thinking, to do the programming and instead presents you with the solution, it is bad. First and foremost, *you* need to do the work. That's why, for Java, we generally recommend the MOOC [Java Programming](https://java-programming.mooc.fi) and for Python the similar MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi), both from the University of Helsinki. These are 100% free, textual, extremely practice oriented courses that give you the tools you need upfront in the text before (not necessarily directly preceding) the exercises and then force you to do the exercises on your own with an online checker. They are both top quality and proper first semesters of Introduction to Computer Science.You mentioned DSA. These are later subjects. They are best learnt when you already have some programming experience through your own (not tutorial) projects so that you can draw relations.Yet, overall, it doesn't seem that the problem is the actual *learning*, the problem is your attitude towards it: you give up as soon as things go rough, you jump around, you never finish anything. As long as you don't change these things, you will not succeed in anything.With your current approach, you will not get anywhere. You need to develop persistence and a certain stubbornness to not give up as soon as things get hard. - This is not something a course can fix. This is something *you* need to fix. Also, this is not even directly related to learning programming. I would bet that this attitude applies in everything you try to learn.You even have a classic here:> I can read code and understand examples. But I can’t build anything.To put it in relation:> You can *read and understand* books, but could you *write* a fully developed, meaningful novel?It's basically the same thing. The former and the latter (both for programming and authoring) are two completely different skillsets that need to be individually trained. You will never get better at programming (or writing novels) if you don't actually *write*, if you don't *practice*. Reading alone doesn't help here. It can extend your horizon, but doesn't give you the skills to directly apply it.I'd suggest that you read through some of the following threads that are very similar:+ https://redd.it/1qdfc9k+ https://old.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pmzjoe/how_do_you_learn_programming/nu4ufej/+ https://redd.it/1pmzjoe+ https://redd.it/1p7bv8a+ https://redd.it/1oynnlv+ https://redd.it/1ouvtzo+ https://redd.it/1opcu7j+ https://redd.it/1on6g8o+ https://redd.it/1ofe87jEven though you already have some of the best books you can buy, some more suggestions:+ ""Think Like A Programmer"" by V.

You need to fix this so you can do well and build confidence. A good short book I read on this was ""How to Become A Straight A Student"", where the author basically just shares study strategies that work for each major type of course, and general advice for doing well in college. I had similar complaints until I accepted that maybe I was the problem and needed to change how I approached everything - when I did, there was a night and day difference in how well I did in all courses.Arrays are fundamental. Like anything else, just spend more time working with them. A very fundamental thing in all of computing is to have a ""list"" of something, and have code that processes that list in some way.> Professors at college barely teach anymoreTry not to be dependent on the quality of the professor or course. I know that can be difficult to accept. However, most of the learning is going to happen in your own time in the cycle of solving problems for HW and exam prep. And for projects, use them as practice in breaking down problems to smaller chunks that can be more easily solved (and bonus points for learning how to use a debugger and how to write basic tests that keep your projects on the rails and help you not get as bogged down when you make changes).When possible, use supplemental things like a REPL (node for JS, jshell for Java, etc.) or scratch files in your IDE if available, to quickly experiment with small ideas.> and they get annoyed when I ask questionsthis is common. The reason they get annoyed is that people tend to ask questions before really investing any time in the assignment or embracing the struggle that is part of the learning process. How to handle this is simply to start homework as early as possible, make as much progress as possible, flag questions when they come up but move on to other stuff to keep making overall progress, then try to get help on those questions from other students or TAs before going to the professor. Try to only use the professor as a last resort, and only after you've already put in effort and can ask a clear, specific question.> self taughtA way to succeed in college is to view it as self-taught, rather than as if the professor is inserting knowledge into your head. The difference is just that the material is being provided to you in a structured way according to what the university and instructors have decided is important to teach, rather than of your choosing, so you end up getting exposure to things that you might not otherwise have chosen to do, which can be good & bad.

Moving the window one step only changes a single data point. To make the list sorted again you only need to move this specific point to the correct place. Going a bit further into potential optimizations you can also notice that if the point that's dropping out of the window (`op`) and the point that enters the window (`np`) are both larger or smaller than the current median, the median won't change and you can just replace `op` with `np` without resorting the list. Another observation is that if `op` and `np` are on different sides of the median, you don't actually have to resort everything to rebalance both sides because the balance can be easily restored by moving one element to the correct side:* `op` < median < `np`: move the smallest element to the right the median to the left of the median; this element is now also the largest element of the left. The new median lies between this element and the new smallest element on the right side.* `op` > median > `np`: Find the biggest element on the left side and move it to the right; it's now the smallest element on the right.By using those observations and moving from fully sorting the window to simply partitioning it you should be able to make updating it much cheaper because you no longer have to shift all elements between `op` and `np` to either the left of the right.",sidit77,2026-01-17 09:01:49,1,learnprogramming,t3_1qf3ex6,False,

A lot of the “name vibe” you want can come from rules, phoneme patterns, and weighted randomness, and you will learn faster by building a baseline you can compare against.If you do want ML, the roadmap I would follow is: get comfortable in Python first, then learn how to prep text data, then try a simple character-level model that generates outputs conditioned on your input root. Start small with a dataset where you have pairs like (root, modern name) and ignore multi-step history at first. Once that works, you can add intermediate forms as extra training examples or as a multi-stage pipeline.The hardest part will be the dataset, not the model. Etymology data is messy and sparse, and “multiple steps through history” is basically asking for aligned sequences across languages and time. I would prototype with whatever clean pairs you can get, then iterate.

nzostd6,"You have more flexibility in c++. How you pass an object can be used to indicate ownership and lifetime management of the object. What follows is what I try to practice, but I'm sure others have had more experience...You can pass by reference, that typically indicates the callee doesn't own the object and must assume it exists whilst and only until the function returns (or if passed to a constructor, whilst the exists). It places restrictions on the object which can be used to ensure you don't do things you shouldn't with it, and can be used to refer to automatically allocated objects.You can pass a unique_ptr, the implication being that ownership is handed to the callee. Or const unique_ptr, meaning the callee can use and modify the object, but not move ownership to something else.You can pass by shared_ptr, ownership is shared and lifetime managed by the pointer. I rarely used these. There are also weak_ptrs but I've not yet had to use them.Sometimes it's perfectly valid to just pass a copy too.I try to avoid using raw pointers in c++ unless forced to, e.g. using a posix or third party C API, and if given one, I'll try and wrap them in a unique_ptr with custom deleter where and as soon as possible, so I don't forget to clean them up.

It also asks for an unnecessary addition on every loop iteration. The compiler will probably optimize that out, but textually you're expressing something different from what you actually mean. Your loop should EITHER go until the pointer reaches some limiting address value, OR until some count is reached. For what you're doing, choose the count by comparing N to zero.* The variable names are unhelpful. What is N? By convention it looks like the array size, but it only means that at the start of the loop. It's actually the number of items remaining to be visited. And what is A? It's not the address of an array A, it's the address of an element of that array.* The empty initialization of the for loop means you're expressly designing this code to leave artifacts available for the rest of the block. Sometimes that's useful, but not here. Those artifacts are A, pointing just past the last element of the array, and N, which will by definition be zero.

o0fv71r,"TLDR: The reality is most starting out heavily lack basic DSA or basic language functionality like stacks, heaps, and virtual space. There are countless things to learn but overall I recommend advancing in DSA and don't feel rushed to know everything. Take your time deeply understanding the simple stuff. Ask questions where things are assumed and seem obvious. If you can really feel what's going on it will stick better. If you're going to Leetcode try to stay in a particular topic for a while and avoid spreading your learning too thin across many different challenges back to back.I was in and out of university for a while and in between completed Coding Dojo Full Stack Development (don't recommend), made a bunch of projects and eventually a successful app on iOS and Android. You might already know many of these topics but this is what I find useful.What I learned is that anything.js (edit I mean most .js solutions, not literally a project called anything.js lol) React, Angular, etc. these full stack web frameworks are constantly changing and new trendy APIs are always coming. Many new APIs are made when someone has some slight problem with the existing options. The right way to use them imo is to know the good general fundamentals like CRUD, validations, DB servers and back end controllers for them, MVC structures, dynamic pages and templates and when you come across some new API you must use that's the only time to get into the specifics and spend time on it - when you need to.Leetcode is good with the right mindset. You can spend too much time on topics that don't improve your skills that much or focusing on the difficulty more than what you're actually learning. Every programmer should strive to be solid in DSA. Focus on things like arrays, binary trees, string modification and linked lists. Take your time to know the little things well. Ask AI for small learning project ideas and when you don't know something syntax or language specific don't ask AI but check the documentation because there you will be surprised at when else you come across or multiple examples of using a function. Try to solve the Skyline problem. The skill level rating shouldn't get in the way of what you want to learn. If knowing how to solve that problem advances you then just take your time on it and try to have solid knowledge in the small steps. If you learn how every little part of a single problem takes all day when you could've done a bunch of random ones to feel more comfortable in the language, it's fine because the former will stick with you.Maybe do a simple learning project in hash maps, or make a multi multi level index database with JSON files and JS and see how you can optimize it. Take a JSON file with test data and make a function that splits it to 3 files where the first is an index, and the next two is part A and B. See how you can modify the function to take number of files/splits and how to split them. For learning I try to keep my attention in the same realm for a while so don't jump around too much or do a project that spreads your attention thin.Those skills will follow you everywhere you go but a new JS API probably won't help you with much else.Know the topics that are needed but programmers starting out struggle with or are frequently missed either by curriculum or not needing it in a specific language:\- What is a stack and heap?\- What is a virtualized address?\- Asymmetric vs symmetric encryption, passkey generation, basic structure of encrypting and decrypting data and how to ensure you're doing it safely.\- When to use structured SQL data or NoSQL. What are the pros and cons? You can use both in an app so what do you want strict and what should be flexible?\- Allocation for data types.Relating to networking I don't know what fundamental work is needed I haven't dealt with that much yet, but less low level topics are solutions that reduce data redundancy, but also latency which can fight redundancy, and the size of transfers all while keeping security which can also fight latency for users. We are producing and sharing data in a rapidly growing rate as the corporate world wants everything cloud based and as AI does what it do. Any little changes to make an app function just as fast and secure but with less data being transferred or stored is very valuable.

I don't begrudge a smart guy, an ideas guy - he can certainly think at a higher level than anyone else, but that he neglected the practicals and tangibles... In essence, he failed to articulate his ideas. It makes me suspect he was gaming the doctoral program for the title, which does happen.

o0vboqg,"I can demonstrate a linked list in C++, I'm very rusty in Java... template class list {In Java, you'd call this a generic, but generics are run-time type information; it's a run-time parameter with extra syntax. In C++, templates are Turing Complete, type safe source code generators. class node: public std::tuple { public: using std::tuple::tuple; };Classes in C++ are `private` access by default. Here I describe a `node`, which is just a kind of tuple, but I have to deal with 55 years of legacy and syntax. using node_ptr = node*; node_ptr head, *tail; std::size_t size;Java manages memory under the hood, here we're a bit more manual. The nodes will be dynamically allocated on the heap, and I have to keep tabs of their location with a handle. `head` is a pointer - a handle. It's a variable type that leads to a resource in memory. Since pointers are a variable type, they take memory and are addressable, they are themselves resources, and we can point to them. So `tail` is a pointer to a pointer. public: list(): tail{&head}, size{} {}Public interface from here on out. `list` ctor. I don't even bother to initialize `head`, because I don't have to care. Other languages have different rules and considerations. I could have made this list JUST with a `head` pointer, which means I'd have to take a different approach than I'm showing you. void add(T &t) { *tail = new node{t}; tail = std::get(*tail); ++size; } std::size_t size() const { return size; } bool empty() const { return tail == &head; }`tail` points to the pointer that is going to handle the next `new node`. This is taking advantage of type erasure - which Java also supports. We don't distinguish WHAT sort of `node` pointer we point at. Whether it's a member of `list` or member of `node`, a pointer to `node` is a pointer to `node`. I don't have to ask which pointer I'm pointing at, I don't have to know if the list is empty or not.I'm caching the size of the list for performance, but I've also demonstrated that I can know if the list is empty just by comparing the address `tail` is storing to the address of `head`. Is `tail` pointing at `head`? Then the list must be empty. If `tail` is not storing the address of `head`, then we're not empty. void for_each(std::function fn) { for(node_ptr iter = &head; *tail != iter; iter = std::get(*iter)) { fn(std::get(*iter)); } }Here we hop nodes from `head` to `tail`.I think you know enough Java that you can READ this C++. The trick is applying these principles to Java. A `tail` is a way to append quickly, but you need two levels of indirection to do it. When we add the first element, `head` gets assigned without accessing it directly by name.",mredding,2026-01-21 15:31:52,2,learnprogramming,t1_o0vbbjq,False,

o07sapx,"In addition to what others have said, you need to realize that coding as a ""class"" and hobby by the nature of how it works forces every new concept and lesson to be cumulative even if your school isnt testing you that wayWhat I mean, is that during week one you learn variables and data types and have a test on those. Week 2 you may learn how functions work and be you'll be tested on functions AND variables and data types even if its not on the test because you'll be writing functions with variables in them. So when Week 20 rolls around, you are expected to have a baseline of everything that came before it because those concepts are used to do other things. It may sound stressful, but if you're struggling with new information and not knowing how to start, then like a lot of beginners you likely lack that foundation of skills. Its easy to learn something new, but if youre also only kinda comfortable with the concepts youve learned so far, you arent learning just a new thing. Youre learning a new thing AND still learning the concepts your class has moved past. You likely need practice, repetition is how experienced programmers can type code out quickly. When I need a loop, I dont think about the syntax at all, Ive just typed out a million of them incorrectly and it's muscle memory. So for me, if Im being taught something that assumes I need a loop, I wont be spending any mental energy on the syntax of a loop or any other concept, my entire brain is focused on the new concept. Coding is hard for new programmers, but if you feel you're getting overwhelmed, id implore you to consider looking backwards and not forwards, because you may not be hitting a wall due to the new concepts being tough, but rather because you're attempting to learn the new concepts while the old concepts are still being mastered. And if you feel thats the case, build things, use those things and repeat them over and over again until they're muscle memory. You're a CS student, so it probably irks you when you see people typing with their pointer finger. But if you think back, you probably were annoyed learning to properly touch type and keep your hands in the correct position. But now you dont even think twice about typing, your brain thinks of a word and your hands do the motion required.

You don't want to distract yourself you want to decompress emotionally and let your new reality settle in, low stimulus time.Once you're ready to start hunting then you update your linkedin and get your resume together. Take your time but don't take too long, you can always update it more as you apply. Start sending out apps, I would aim for at least 50 a week. Personally I never did the tailor the resume per application and fuck that cover letter shit, but at the same time apply for places where you're a reasonable fit. Apply for startups, big tech, and everything in between. At this point you just want to pump the numbers, get your feet wet, and collect data.Track all your job apps in a spreadsheet listing out what platform you applied, what version of your resume you applied with (if you modify it), and if you were rejected or not. This will help you tailor your strategy and give you success rates to A/B test approaches against. I had about a 5-10% callback rate on cold apps and a 20% callback rate on recruiter DMs/inmail (moved past the screening round). This is a pretty solid ratio to have in today's climate.Also start connecting with a ton of tech recruiters and if you see a job with a good fit DM the recruiter directly with a short message, the job link, and your resume.Aim to spend half your day doing leetcode /system design and the other half on job apps. Always be interview ready and at the beginning take every interview you can get even if it's something you would never accept just to build your confidence.The big thing is to always rethink your approach and try tweaking different strategies to see what gets better results.

o0oijiy,"Preface: I'm currently a remote SDE at Netflix, but I'm only one opinion, others might have different views obviously.First let me point out two facts:1. Getting a call != getting the job. You are getting the cart in front of the horse a bit, so I'd highly recommend you not get too excited. It is very hard to get an offer from Netflix, I've seen jobs stay open for 6+ months waiting for the perfect candidate to come through. Also, if anyone is ahead of you in the pipeline and they accept an offer, Netflix will immediately cancel all interviews with anyone currently in the hiring pipeline. I'm not telling you this to get you down, I've just seen too many folks surprised and disappointed by this.2. Lets be honest, if you get an offer you are going to take the job. It doesn't really matter what I say after this.To answer your actual questions:>What's the catch?There's no catch. Its a good company to work for, but the keeper test is a real thing. You need to do good work to stay employed. There are people who definitely coast, but that's not common.>Are remote workers more likely to get laid off or get plateaued on their salary growth compared to the ones who go to the office every day?No. I suppose if you were the type of person who wants to go from Engineering Manager to Senior Director or something I'm betting it's a journey only to be successfully traveled with a lot of in-office ass kissing.>How’s the pay growth like in general on the base salary every year as there’s no bonus?I would say to get the idea of ""pay growth"" out of your mind. First of all, based on you saying you were at a financial company, I'm guessing that your pay will probably double when coming to Netflix. Given that, if it doesn't grow from there, would that be terrible? Netflix has terms/acronyms for how they do or don't increase pay, I won't bother spelling them all out. The TL;DR is if pay in the industry goes up across the board, then Netflix pay will go up. If it doesn't go up or it goes down (like it has for the past 3 years), Netflix pay will stay the same. You will never get a pay cut at least, but you also won't get a pay raise. In the 2018-2021 timeline people were getting huge raises each year. For the past 3 years, pay has been flat.>How well do they honor the unlimited paid time off policy? How many vacation days do y’all take every year?They honor it. I don't take a lot of time off, but that's a personal choice, but there are people on my team taking 30 days off per year easily. We don't really keep track honestly, there's no place to click some button to take time off. I just tell my manager my plans and then set my self as out-of-office on my google calendar and slack and that's about it.>How’s the parental leave policy and do they honor it wellAFAIK they do. There was someone in my greater org gone for nearly a year after their baby was born.>What do you think about the health insurance they offer?It's fine, pretty standard. The HSA plan is usually the clear winner.>Are there any signs of remote roles becoming fully in-person anytime soon?No, not at all. My org is almost entirely remote. The only rumor I've heard was from the Ads org requiring in-office, but that team is almost all ex-Meta and ex-Amazon, so who knows what those nerds are up to.",Optimus_Primeme,2026-01-20 15:28:08,190,cscareerquestions,t3_1qi2tzm,False,

Some intern managers are great, some are just mediocre, but this is unusually bad.That said, this is an opportunity to make the best out of a bad situation, so here's my advice:First, do the work you're assigned, no matter how stupid or boring it sounds. Finish copying the data to Excel, email it to your manager and ask for more.If you get more, do it as professionally as you possibly can, even if it seems boring and stupid. Part of the experience of working at a company is that sometimes you have to do boring, stupid work. Doing it well is necessary for success.However, for the rest of your time, you should have two goals:1. Make yourself useful2. Learn as much as you canYou're in an amazing position right now. You have access to a whole company full of professionals, and almost no responsibilities.This is a fantastic opportunity, if you want to take advantage of it.Who cares what department you're in? Start meeting people in different departments. Tell them you're an intern on the Data Analytics team but you're not very busy and you'd like to help.It won't be hard to find someone who has some work for you.I don't recommend keeping it a secret! Tell your manager you did all of your Excel work, and that you met someone in another department who gave you a task. I highly doubt your manager will care.And of course, your goal is to learn something. Find people who are actually good at their jobs (unlike your manager) and are interested in teaching you how they do them.Having your manager give you a good review at the end of your internship is nice, but it isn't the only good outcome. Any other employee who ends up impressed with you at the end of the internship could end up being a great resource. When you apply to future jobs and give a reference, you don't have to give your manager - give some other senior employee who liked you. And make contacts with as many people as you can, and when you're graduating, contact all of them to ask for referrals.",dmazzoni,2026-01-19 06:42:25,55,cscareerquestions,t3_1qgw9t5,False,

o0fw2iw,"I would say it’s about 50-50. Take a look at the comments, you’re gonna see some people saying it’s unusual… And then some people saying it’s normal.At the end of the day, I feel like it’s 50-50, and beyond that the real question is… What are you gonna do about it?If you don’t feel like you have work… The answer is the same. Ask somebody to give you something to do. But here’s the thing… The best thing you could possibly do is make the best of the opportunity you have. As long as you do that, you’ll leave on positive terms and be able to ask for letters of recommendation in the future. That’s your end goal.So here are some ideas… Ask someone what is the most important codebase for you to investigate? What are some fundamental principles that you can look up, if you’re interested doing that person’s job? What is a problem that the company currently has that could provide value for the company if it was solved?Be sure to let people know that they can answer this in a very high-level, simple way if they don’t have a lot of time. Let them know that you’re not trying to interfere with their daily work… But more so, you’re trying to find some things to dig into and research independently. After a while if you’re at a good internship position, they’re going to give you some more useful work… but if you’re at a bad place, this is going to be all you get. Either way, though, if you take this approach, everyone will know that you tried, and you would have documented evidence that you asked C questions and got Y answers. Document everything (your questions, the answers, and the research/work you did), and write up report from your internship. Save it somewhere. Memorize a 30 second breakdown of what you did. If you do this, it won’t matter if you have three bad internships. You will seem more prepared, and experienced, than 90% of all candidates for other jobs. The real skill to legitimately learn and to genuinely get jobs is to:1. Do your best, genuinely.2. Document what you did, at every place on your résumé.3. Create a logical and truthful story about what you learned..4. Always learn, at every position, even if you’re learning about what not to do (pay special attention to proactively investigating how you can provide value… and managing yourself in a way that provides value to the company).You can do all of this systematically no matter what anyone else does. You don’t have to be a genius, and you don’t have to become a rockstar. All you have to do is to provide documentation that you work hard and are willing to reasonably spend your paid time, focusing on providing value for the people that pay you (if at all possible).The worst thing you should say about the company is, “Even though I had very little guidance, I was able to spend company time improving documentation [something you were told was important] and learning about [something you proactively researched]”You should always be looking for how this internship can provide value for you. If someone helps you provide value for the company, great! But if no one is giving you work to do, make sure you get what you need from that opportunity. This could impact how much money you make (10k-20k+ a year)… or it could impact if you get a good entry-level position.I purposely did not respond in a way that had anything to do with, how to make the company act differently. Because this is something you cannot control… You should focus on how you can behave in a way that would set you up for success no matter how the company behaves.

I did not have a degree in tech, I used to work as a counselor and wanted to try career switching. I worked help desk until 2024 where I got a new job as app support where I coded for the first time on the job writing some scripts to update our relational db. It was fun but I sucked so bad that they laid me off 5 months in! From July 2024 until October 2025 I worked my butt off teaching myself how to code. I worked a few small contracts, contributed to open source, and made a ton of friends in tech by going to local meetups and occasional conferences (got in for free either through volunteering or finding people who were giving away tickets). This past October I landed an offer and have been working as a full time SWE.The market absolutely sucks and it took me over a year just to find a role but the main thing I did was stay in community to help encourage me when I felt like throwing in the towel.

I see people telling you tot need to apply to 1000-1500 jobs. That’s not quite accurate. There’s some randomness to it all. The more you apply, the more you have a chance for finding something that aligns with you. But it’s not a guarantee, and some people luck out and find something sooner. - People are really bad with perspective. There’s nothing wrong with what you wrote about yourself, but there’s an issue of scale and perspective. How do you compare to all the other people currently looking? There’s no way to answer that, but it can be hard to stand out from the crowd. There will be a lot of people with similar backgrounds, better backgrounds, and worse backgrounds. You can’t control much except making yourself a better candidate and trying to give yourself as many opportunities as possible. Anyway, you have to just understand that rejection is a part of life, and it’s a part of the job search process. That’s easier said than done. Regarding false certainty, that’s just part of life. There is just a lot of uncertainty in life. If you’re a sports fan, there’s uncertainty in the outcome of a game. There’s what likely will happen, but no guarantee. Some don’t watch because of anxiety. Others watch and let the result really impact them, and others watch and move on with their lives.

o0kejf2,"There's likely a disconnect somewhere between you and your work. It could be a number of things, but from what I've heard from some people who burnt out and similar to you, they just slowly stopped caring anymore. It's usually 1 of 2 things, either you had clear goals in life and are finding yourself not getting closer to them, or you were constantly under some ethereal pressure to always deliver and been told what you were doing mattered -- but it really didn't.In the first case, it usually manifests in the form of a midlife crisis i.e. realizing you're not where you want to be and your life's almost over, which you sound young enough and are on a decent trajectory (gf + social circle/gym) to not be applicable to.The second case is clear overworking, I'm talking like 70-100 hours a week for years which doesn't seem like your case.Then lastly, there's also a sort of mix of the two in high-achieving younger folk I've noticed in recent years. Those who were mostly successful in life and then landed great gigs out of uni, constantly being told they're delivering mission critical things and are a part of something bigger. After a few years, you start to realize, if you took some PTO, missed some deliverables or just straight stopped working for more than 1 hour a day like yourself, nothing really bad happens. Work moves on, your company and coworkers move on, and really nothing you do is that critical to the business. For most, this is OK, but if you made it a part of your personality for the past 5-20 years of your life, then it could cause this divergence/burnout you're experiencing.Personally speaking, I was never really an early overachiever but knew a few in the Bay Area who skyrocketed their schooling/careers really fast and burnt out hard. I don't really have advice but it seemed like those who went through it had to soul search for a long time to get out of it (some became NEETs or worked in unrelated jobs for a few years), or just switched and coasted at a smaller company until they shifted their perspective or found something they cared about.",terrany,2026-01-19 23:09:31,14,cscareerquestions,t3_1qhjehf,False,

Doing some tinkering with AWS and getting familiar with their primitives would probably be one of the most impactful things you can do to increase your value in the job market, since it'll naturally open you up to lots more companies/stacks.Some thoughts inline for your other questions:> If you took a break or had a gap, what helped you come back and get hired?Get your story straight. Ideally, both your internal story (for yourself, what you wanted out of it, what you ended up getting) as well as your public story.But if you can only do one, get the public story *concise* and have the elevator pitch ready to deliver when the inevitable question comes up in the interview. You want 1-2 polished sentences about why you took the time off, what you accomplished, and how you're thinking about your return to full-time work.Practice telling the story, over and over, until it sounds natural.> Should I focus on DE roles again or pivot to backend/SWE?Remember that you also need to like the job you end up getting. ;) It's okay to focus, especially initially.If you do end up going for general backend/SWE roles, make sure to have different version(s) of your resume for those roles.> What’s a realistic plan for the next 8–12 weeks that actually improves interview outcomes?One underrated tool is mock interviews. Hire paid, experienced mock interviewers that actually have work and interview experience at the kinds of companies you want to join.Schedule at least one mock interview every couple weeks. That way, you're getting *real* feedback every couple weeks with specific guidance on what to work on.For me, right before my real interview, I also then loaded up one last wave of mock interviews to get in a bunch more practice.It gets expensive, but you should be able to make back everything (and more) with your signing bonus.> What do recruiters/hiring managers in India care about most when they see a 6 month gap?Oops... my advice is from experience in the US. Adjust accordingly. :)> Any suggestions for 1–2 “resume-worthy” projects that are actually useful (not a toy) and can be finished quickly?Paying for a training or a course certificate *from an actual credible source* can be a nice bullet point. It shows you're willing to invest in yourself, literally, and it shows you can learn on your own.Good luck! And don't beat yourself up about taking a break. It's *very* common.

When it comes to Front End work items on our board in DevOps, I am usually the one that gets handed these types of tickets since front end work is pretty much straightforward and self explanatory. “Self-sufficient, don’t need handholding” — I’ve noticed probably within the past 4 months that for this portion I am starting to be more self sufficient, but occasionally I do need support or guidance getting through the work item. For instance, I had to edit a table (database migration for C#) on one of our database tables for an application that we are in the midst of building and kind of got lost. I had to nudge one of our lead developers for some assistance, but I still occasionally do need help with more difficult problems that I sometimes run into. “Can own features end-to-end” — for this specific point, this is NOT true with me. If you really do own features end to end I expect these to be more front end feature work items, but not back end stuff. I struggle with back end work items immensely. Correct me if I am wrong please!!!“Collaborate with other teams on system design and write ADRs” — At my company, we really don’t have “ADRs”. Sure we understand the things we work on, but my company is so small that having things like this does not really benefit us. For bigger companies I could definitely see the benefit of this. My coworker who has been doing Software Engineering for 15 years wrote up the architecture design documents and database schema for a new application we are releasing soon about 6 months ago. He knew EXACTLY how to get it done, how long it would take, and how hard it would be. That’s something I totally expect from someone with that much experience. It also depends heavily on the work place you are at. Especially what you work on, how difficult it is, and if you are learning new things. I would say that from what you said in your post and comparing where I am at, we are probably in a similar spot. Now I don’t know how much you make, but I expect the next job you get (hopefully for me too) you will make substantially more. What I would work on for improving your knowledge is maybe look at more back end specific problems. I am currently working on a full stack application that calls a local database and uses REST to grab information from said database. I had a coworker who moved on to bigger and better things that told me back end development is where the big money is at.

o0b83rh,"I don't know, I'm ~4 yoe but have been bounced to my 4th job already.I would say the landscape is changing really rapidly with no one truly knowing where LLM's are going to land when the dust settles.It's always going to be different where you work.Generally speaking I think a decent 2 yoe shouldBe able to take small to medium tasks independently. Know who to go to ask to get information to handle some ambiguity, know when to ask team lead / senior when it's getting too big.Jr Devs seem more rare, but being able to help them or pair program and learn together to at least do the easy tickets.At least be able to take a stab at a small to medium problem and make some kind of drawing. Maybe use LLM to help and then make sure you understand what you made. Senior dev probably still modified or rejects solution.DevOps specifically just depends where you work. I found I need to know how CI/CD works and some basic to touching intermediate topics about AWS / K8 for interviews. I have only gotten the opportunity to write unit tests and update yaml files and deploy docker containers, so I can't speak there. I had dedicated DevOps teams at my other jobs.So my opinion (that may not be that accurate) is learn as you go and get your work done in a timely manner. If you have time afterwards review the work and make sure you get it.When you get to interviews though, different ball park. They want you to know (in my experience):the ability to system design large projects, solve medium LC's in 10-15 mins or a custom coding challenge, random trivia of basic to intermediate topics about your coding languages, varying levels of DevOps questions, SQL questions including asking specific syntax or make a query right now verbally or type in chat, strong behavioral stories that show impact and good team dynamics / easy to work with.. Then I got my job offer finally, and I'm potentially being bait and switched to doing lowcode despite needing to be some on paper super coder to get the job :face_with_tears_of_joy:",Super-Blackberry19,2026-01-18 16:17:21,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1qf6xt2,False,

Since you've been out for a bit, I'd suggest really hammering those behavioral questions too, especially around explaining your sabbatical in a way that shows growth and self-awareness. You're likely to get probed about it so it's best to be prepared. Technical-wise, focus on LeetCode mediums and understand the time/space complexity like the back of your hand. For implementation rounds, practice writing clean, testable code quickly; it personally helped me to time myelf while coding to sort of simulate what I'd encounter during interviews.

o0f46op,"Part of my job is mentoring the Team and Tech leads that report to me. A couple of them are 15+ years my senior, and just ended up ""stuck"" at that level. Both of these guys are very smart, great developers, and good mentors to the Junior and Senior engineers on their teams. Their problem is the same thing I've seen skilled developers fall prey to over and over again throughout my career: lack of understanding of the business impact of their job.You likely have seen this as you've done Product Owner/Manager roles, so you're already ahead of the game. At the end of the day, though, lots of developers don't want to think about what they are doing in the context of the business, either because they just want to focus on the how and not the why, or because they are afraid of dealing with something that isn't as clean and clear-cut as solving a technical problem. Both of these Leads at my company have these sentiments, despite them understanding that they need to do more.The thing that helped me advance in my career and make sure never to stagnate, was to develop the business skills that helped me understand just how my work as a developer directly impacted the business. It helped me understand what to focus on, how to prioritize work that got the most impact internally and externally, and how to communicate critical needs to business stakeholders, especially in the form of long term support in favor of building tons of shiny new features as fast as possible.Those skills have proven to be transferable in a way that mastery of a specific language or framework simply haven't. I was stuck as a JavaScript dev for the first 8 years of my career, despite moving into a Team Lead role, because I wasn't focusing on the business problems as a whole and instead acted as the tool used to implement a solution someone else came up with. It was in this role that I started to be exposed to the larger discussions around what we were building, and why, which helped me realize that if I added my own voice to the conversation, I could influence what was happening and be seen as much more valuable than a simple code monkey.This helped me pivot to other languages and frameworks, including hopping from entirely Node/Vue.js as my stack to .NET/React with no real experience in either. I could understand the business reasons for why decisions were being made, which convinced my soon to be boss to hire me and take the chance that I could get up to speed on their stack in a reasonable amount of time.Now that I am in management, I use those skills constantly, but I still actively try to code in my spare time. For this, AI has been immensely helpful! I use Claude Code daily, whether its for doing the bulk of the super basic coding that I'd probably have done with snippets anyways while I handle the complex business logic, or having it explain the codebases I have access to but don't work in and still need to help make technical decisions for. I basically treat Claude as a pocket engineer who never needs to sleep, gets way too eager and excited and sometimes needs to be reigned in, but is still clever and helpful. I've used it to help me build fully custom applications specific to my company, Claude API cloud agents that help my engineers debug their work completely autonomously, and basically just manage my day to day work life.All of this is to say that you can still work on the things you are good at, enjoy doing, and still be a coveted asset companies would fight to have. Embrace AI as a way to level up the skills you already have and fill in the gaps you're missing. If you use it as a crutch while you're learning the strategic thinking required to lead a technology company, even if you have no desire to be a CTO/CEO, you'll be able to navigate this new AI powered world while still doing what you love. You don't have to go into management to influence the direction of a company either.

o0jrw58,"The best way is really taking an interest in the discussions around what you and your team are building. This is obviously easier if you are part of an organization with a product team, but there are always stakeholders in every project. Instead of sitting back and being assigned work, ask why that decision was made. Play the junior card and your desire to learn, you'd be surprised just how many people get excited to explain why they have made a decision. Ask to shadow the discussion with stakeholders, then debrief with the other members of your team. Its important to remember that this is going to be extra work outside of your normal responsibilities, so you still need to get all of your work done or else you can lose peoples' trust. But the skill of learning from people more experienced and rapidly absorbing new knowledge is critical to succeeding long term as a software developer.Also, use AI as a coach. Even if you aren't allowed to use AI at work, you can still generally get away with telling it roughly the feature/functionality/application you and your team are building, the context of your company, and relevant tech stacks, then have it explain what it thinks are the likely business decisions. Then take that to the people involved in deciding the work that's been done and explain ""your thoughts"" and see how they line up. If you are allowed to use AI at work, instead of using it as a fancy auto-complete try to use it as a pair programming coach and have it explain why decisions and patterns may have been used. All this needs to be done with a healthy understanding that the AI very likely could be wrong, but at least it gives you a jumping off point to go confirm with somene who knows.",ShockinglyApparent,2026-01-19 21:16:09,2,cscareerquestions,t1_o0fws64,False,
o0k0mlp,"The most organic way is to insert yourself into discussions involving decisions made with stakeholders. At a more senior level, you should have the knowledge and skills to be able to look at an abstract problem and implement a robust solution. The key here is that often times engineers with those skills still act like more junior devs, simply taking orders and doing things how they are always done at the company. This is where you can approach these discussions from your side. Instead of simply taking orders, insert yourself into stakeholder discussions and talk through what they are looking for and give options on how to build what they want. You'll have to come prepared with the ability to explain what you want to implement at a level that less/non-technical people can understand. But if you keep showing up with good solutions on how to implement what people want, and can deliver on that implementation, you'll start to get invited to more and more of these discussions. Also, use AI to brainstorm and propose new design patterns for features. There's always the caveat that AI can very likely be wrong, but its a good jumping off point. Since you're new to it, just treat it like a conversation with another developer. Tell the agent when its wrong or has made a mistake and constantly give it new context. Ask it how you can improve the information you're giving it to help it come up with better answers. I am constantly getting better at working with AI agents, because I just throw problems at it and see what works. It seems kind of silly to think of it as a skill, but you really do get better working with them simply by putting in the time. I pay for the $100/month Claude Max plan and find it incredibly worth it, because I can have an idea and blitz my way through a rough implementation and decide if its worth pursuing, while also getting better at working with the agent, all in my personal time. At work, I am lucky enough to have the budget to spend a fairly sizable amount of money on Claude API tokens, primarily because I have proven the value of it to my boss, but I wouldn't have gotten there if I hadn't been experimenting on fun personal projects like my homelab server, custom websites and webapps for little hobby projects, and a healthy chunk of home automation.As far as resources go, one of the best books I was introduced to by a college professor of mine is called The Lean Startup by Eric Ries. It may be about building a startup, but the skills are extremely transferable to existing companies. Every single business needs to spend resources efficiently to survive, and understanding where you can deliver value the most is key to success. Also, I very recently discovered Lenny's Newsletter, which is a site with an enormous amount of content around Product development, Engineering, and how leaders in the AI space use AI to run their businesses and professional lives. I've just started digging into it, but its been really eye opening on how I have just been scratching the surface of using AI, and I already have several fully custom AI tools in use that I build explicitly to help me manage my teams at work.",ShockinglyApparent,2026-01-19 21:59:33,1,cscareerquestions,t1_o0hw77i,False,

Since you already have a referral that got you into a big company, leverage that network to get more internal referrals and ask for informational chats at target firms; those conversations often matter more than a piece of paper. Meanwhile, keep your resume tight by highlighting measurable impact (e.g., performance improvements, cost savings, productionized models) and consider short, targeted certifications or workshops if you need a specific skill gap filled. When you start applying, broaden your search beyond the usual big‑tech listings—platforms that aggregate remote and on‑site opportunities can surface roles that match your experience and career goals without the extra overhead of a full program.
