If average transaction amounts suddenly double, that's a red flag even if the values are technically valid.* Monitor schema changes proactively. When a new status code appears or a column's type shifts, alert on it instead of silently dropping data.* Compare against historical baselines. A 15% change in distinct customer counts might be normal growth, or it might be double-counting. Context matters.The tricky part is reducing false positives—weekend vs weekday patterns, seasonality, etc. I've been using type-specific thresholds and adaptive baselines (moving averages for high-variance columns, prior period for seasonal ones).Schema and row counts are easy; catching that a source system changed from dollars to cents is harder.

nqvym96,"This is a broad question so I will give you an broad answer.I prefer a minimal orch layer and split the data pulling from transformation layer unless you require a very complex normalisation and cleaning. So it depends. How complex the data is and how forward you go towards the insights/analytics layer? If the data is not complex and you insights to be extracted, delegate this to a modelling tool like dbt and use your pipelines to pull data only and trigger dbt to keep it simple. If data is complex requiring many normalisations or multiple sources that a simple sql cannot do, threat your pipelines like a library to process data in its context. But remember early optimisation is the evil. So its not a question of preference, is what you have to do at THIS time to keep it simple, readable and maintainable for your future self without over engineering. This rule is only yours (or maybe also for your team). Sometimes it is ok to over-bloat one or two flows because you will touch that once in a year and nobody else will or if it fails nobody will get hurt. I personally consider this and also I don't mind to have duplicated code 3x into 3 flows, so the 4th one will justify a refactor.

Because of this tendency, I think the book is important to read before entering DE *and* to revisit often in your career. Tools and techniques make it easy to lose sight of why you exist as a DE in the first place; as important as knowing the ins and outs of spark or airflow is, the business doesn't care about how you did it. They care about value and they care about cost. If you don't know that, you kind of don't know anything.

Production is very much off the leash.I've found co-pilot adds value to PRs.It saw a pattern in something I was doing with some legacy DBT code and recommended changes in many files. It was 80% right. Because I am wary of automated code correction I spotted the 20% incorrect recommendations so it did save a lot of time. Had I accepted it's recommendations blindly or decaffeinated then that 20% would have burnt through the savings and more.AI has also found those little bugs that are obvious but only after you've seen them.One thing worries me with Agentic AI is largely my ignorance.

Statistical tests (KS, PSI) still work on samples. For categoricals, stratified sampling helps catch rare value changes. For partitioned tables, profile only the latest partition(s) instead of full history.In terms of frequency, I run lightweight profiling (schema, basic stats) on every run, and save detailed stats for a few runs per day. Tier by importance—critical tables every run, others maybe 2–3x daily.I built a profiling tool that does adaptive sampling (random, stratified, top-k) and handles partitions.

Airbyte and Pipelinewise are good, but as you noticed, they can be brittle with type mismatches. Debezium is great but only if you want to own the complexity.If you end up syncing Postgres into a warehouse and need the targets to stay correct without juggling all the CDC edge cases, a real-time sync layer such as Stacksync can help keep those tables aligned so you don’t have to chase failures down the chain.",novel-levon,2025-11-25 19:03:33,2,dataengineering,t3_1p6fpt5,False,

All data values stay on the user's machine and only DuckDB executes the SQL, so the actual computation is fully local.As for accuracy - you are absolutely right, this is an important area. Since the LLM only generates SQL, the key question is how reliably different models translate natural language into correct SQL for various scenarios.I am currently thinking about adding a golden ground truth test suite where the same set of questions is run across multiple models to measure accuracy objectively. This would let users see which models perform best and how they compare on real tasks.It is clear that people want this kind of transparency, so adding proper accuracy benchmarks is already in my plans.",vtsaplin,2025-11-26 00:30:10,1,dataengineering,t1_nql54ra,True,

It covers most of the user interaction events you mentioned. A few key points:* **Permissions:** You need to be a Fabric (Power BI) Administrator to access activity data for the entire tenant.* **Retention:** The API provides data for the past **30 days**.* **Format:** The output is JSON, which you can easily process and load into Snowflake or any other data warehouse.If you want to go deeper (e.g., dataset usage, queries, refresh history), there are other APIs like:* **Get Refresh History** for semantic models* **Get Reports / Get Datasets** for metadataYou don’t need Purview for this; the audit logs are part of the Power BI service itself.

nr77xel,"Hi u/Cultural-Pound-228 thanks for your reply! 1. Yep, this is the case for every table and also this one, we can identify the PK and normally store the hash as well with it in a new column as we use it to build our data vault/silver layer on it. In case a PK exists, we compare the hash of the concat of all columns except the PK.2. For this specific table we would do a initial load from 2015 to today if we would build the table now and then starting from tomorrow we would load a full year back every day. When loading, we would then compare only records going one year back as otherwise the query would close all records between 2015 and the 28th of November 2024. 3. Yeah, considering Iceberg here! Played with it and the ""timestamp"" function really makes it way easier to go back then playing with the valid from/ valid to date columns. The only thing i can't get my head around is. When we would use snapshots instead of SCD2, then i assume it would be something like:\- Initial load - All rows ranging from 2015 - today with snapshot date today (\~12 mln rows)\- Every day after today - All rows for the last 365 days - snapshot date of that specific date (\~1 mln rows)It adds 365 mln. rows in a year and when i want to know the last version of a PK on a specific date i would need to partition by and order by the PK to get the latest version. Thereby, if a record gets deleted in the source system there's no way to mark it in my append only db without making a SCD2 kind of script that fills in a valid\_to or is\_deleted flag. i'm probably wrong but the snapshot system seems to be best fit in cases you know your source system will never delete anything.",Crazy-Sir5935,2025-11-28 11:05:04,1,dataengineering,t1_nr4o5zk,True,

Use Fabric’s data movement primitives plus an automated control loop, or avoid copying entirely and materialize only what you need.A practical pattern that works for me: (1) do an initial bulk load with a Copy job or Dataflow Gen2 that can target a Warehouse. (2) switch to incremental/CDC for ongoing sync. Fabric has a CDC/Copy job feature and you can also use Delta Change Data Feed in Lakehouse tables to capture row-level changes for reliable upserts. (3) automate discovery of new tables by keeping a metadata table or using the Fabric REST/metadata APIs in a pipeline to list Lakehouse tables and loop over them to create/update copy jobs. Community threads show people scripting this when they need to scale. About schema drift: Fabric’s copy tools can do mapping but they are not perfect at automatically absorbing arbitrary schema changes for all workloads. If you expect frequent schema churn, consider an ELT pattern: keep canonical data in the Lakehouse and run periodic MERGE queries from Lakehouse into Warehouse tables (or materialized views) using the Delta CDF or SQL MERGE so you have deterministic upserts. If you want a starting checklist: pick Copy job for initial load, enable incremental or CDC for high-change tables, build a pipeline that enumerates tables and triggers jobs for new ones, and use Delta CDF or MERGE for schema-safe upserts.

nqtgdww,"In terms of pay, it really depends. Some companies, like Amazon or meta do have different bands for data engineer roles. But imo there are 2 different types of data engineer. 1 more swe focused and 1 more sql focused. Swe focused ones pay the same and sql ones are usually a little less. An example is at my company I am under the swe name but work on and own some DE and my org is paid very well. But we also own the data for lots of high priority ML products. I also think saying data is a cost center is just not super true. I think a lot of companies are viewing data as a service. ML teams require lots and lots of data that is accurate and growing in complexity. This requires lots of work. Most companies are putting a lot of money towards data teams now and are viewed as essential.So in terms of pay I think this is a non factor (there are more important factors like what company you work at and how fast you grow and promote).

When new data arrives, compare against this metadata to determine what's actually new vs. what you can skip.\*\*On the Part\_Number optionality:\*\*Since Parts are optional and variable per AP, I'd process at the AP level and handle Parts within that processing step rather than trying to partition by them.\*\*Alternative approach:\*\*What if you partition by ingestion batch (timestamp when client sends data) rather than by the hierarchical data structure? Each batch could contain multiple EQPs/APs, but you'd process the whole batch as one unit. Downstream, you'd have the full data hierarchy in your warehouse with proper keys for querying.\*\*Question for you:\*\*What drives the need to reprocess individual APs? Is it data corrections from the client, or something else?

You need 3-5x speedup just to break even cost-wise. The real win is if you need results faster rather than cheaper processing.\*\*Why not widespread?\*\*\- Requires code changes and testing\- GPU-enabled clusters cost more upfront\- Many workloads are I/O bound, not compute bound\- Operational complexity (different instance types, drivers, etc.)\*\*My suggestion:\*\*Start with profiling your current Spark jobs. Use Databricks' Spark UI to see where time is actually spent. If you're spending 80% of time on shuffles and joins with minimal I/O, Rapids could help. If you're I/O bound, optimize partitioning and file formats first (Parquet, proper partition keys).Run a small POC on one heavy workload, measure actual speedup vs. cost increase, then decide.Has anyone in the community actually deployed Rapids in production on Databricks?

So, this is not a useful phrase for detecting plagiarism. However, ""fourscore and seven years ago"" *is* improbable.

This utilizes libraries, wikipedia, internet resources, and other online databases that have content to check. Then take a person's work, and cross reference everything in your data base. It will essentially go through line by line, and then look for similarities to the library. I can only think of how to apply it to essays and papers, but it could be:1. Step 1: Start with similar words. The checker will take the piece you're working on, and compare similar words to others. If the piece you're working on reveals a high number of shared words, then it gets ""flagged"" for further examination. 2. Step 2: Take the piece you're comparing, and the other pieces of work that share some close similarities, and then reveal similar phrases/sentences. If the similar phrases ended up being long enough (multiple words/sentences), then the likelihood that it was plagiarized increases. (ie: a phrase ""too bad"" isn't going to flag it, but if someone quotes a full abstract from a scientific paper then it flags it as copied).3. Step 3: determine a way to program it to detect plagiarism vs referencing/quoting other works. You'd have to look up formatting options (like the usage of quotation marks, and other steps required to reference other notations). 4. Step 4: Iterate and reiterate the process until it becomes better, faster, or more robust. For code and math, especially on the lower scale like cs50, it's harder because a lot of the solutions for dedicated questions have 1 solution.

nqtm6sg,"Look at it from a different perspective:When you learn how to be a carpenter, do you go right to building a house to get better? No, you build a crappy chair. Then you keep building several until it looks a little less crappy. Then you build other objects and repeat the process. If you do that enough times, you'll naturally pick up other tools and methodologies that'll help you with your building. Over time, you'll be able to start building a house with your experience. You won't know what many tools are called, names of all the screws, and the best way to use everything. You just pick them up and try them out, learning as you build things..You're a **beginner** trying to build a house (Minecraft mods) when you don't even know what a hammer does (Java). Of course that'll feel overwhelming. First, play around with Java. Follow a tutorial or two about it. Maybe do a course or make something cool. There's no ""am I ready?"" You're ready whenever you say you're ready, whether that's after a 1hr yotube playlist or a several week MOOC. You'll *never* know everything about Java. Never. You can get a PhD in CS with Java and not know how to build a single project. Fortunately, you don't need to know *everything* about Java or CS to accomplish your goals. Don't let that lack of knowledge make you afraid to start building with it. You can start building things even after a simple 1hr tutorial. It would be a far cry from MC mods (little chair vs a hige house), but it's definitely enough to start your journey. I'd probably go through a beginner course utilizing Java. Udemy? Coursera? mooc.fi? Pick your poison. Anything works. [Pick one of the links at the beginning and get started](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjava/comments/1kla4xc/comment/ms0p7yn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).I'd probably go for the Udemy one. Hyperskill is more expensive, but it'll probably be the easiest intro to Java. The mooc is probably going to be very in-depth, and very hard, but free. Probably overkill. Coursera might have some free courses. There are many. Just choose whatever beginner Java course you can find. Whatever your choice is, just go through it until you know a little bit about Java. Your goal is simple exposure and to be able to build small little things that output into a terminal. They likely won't teach you how to build things in MC and you may be exposed to a lot of concepts you won't find immediately useful. Just get comfortable seeing code, using code, and thinking like a programmer.Don't go down a rabbit hole of things (remember the PhD comment?). Java can build practically anything, so you'd be able to learn so much without achieving your goals. Just get the basics down until you're comfortable. .Once you have a basic understanding of what Java is, go straight into learning how to mod.[Here's one resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1csh3yp/comment/l44waul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)[Here's another](https://www.mcjty.eu/docs/intro)There are a lot.Don't freak out. You won't know anything really. The above Java stuff was just getting you used to the hammer, nails, properties of wood, etc (depending on the resource, you may have built a chair or two).This, however, is the real deal. You're actually going to start building chairs, and it's going to suck and it will look like crap. You won't even know a lot of the things being talked about and you'll feel like you're at the very beginning again. That's okay and perfectly normal. You have to acquire a few more tools, but Java is the biggest learning curve and the one everything interacts with, so it's the one I recommended getting comfortable with first. Go through tutorial after tutorial about Minecraft mods, follow the beginner steps, and try to recreate things as they do it. Then try to do it again without the video, pausing each time. Then try to manipulate what you've created, or even break it. Then try to repeat the entire process from scratch until you recreate it (minus the setting up your tools part).Then move on to the next tutorial. Once you've acquired enough small skills, try to go about building a simple little thing yourself (you can even try after your first tutorial). This simple thing might be insanely hard. You might have to reference different documentation and videos to help you out. Once you finally finish it, try to improve it. Try to recreate it if you really want to reinforce the knowledge. Then move onto the next idea. Once you do that enough, you should be able to see other people's source code for their projects and be able to pick out little bits and pieces that you might want to try yourself, or research about to see what it does. Try to contribute to an open source mod or pull from their projects and play around with the code. That series of building is what will eventually get you to creating your own big ideas. People legit go through the Kaupenjoe videos (first link) without even knowing *any Java* and successfully learn how to build projects after a year. You can start that way too, but I thought maybe it'd feel better knowing a little bit about Java first (if you already don't know anything). If you're overwhelmed, skip everything I told you and go straight to that. It'll be very hard and scary, but learning to program is a marathon, not a single sprint..I can't really help you beyond that. Things take time. Don't stress about memorizing everything, being perfect in everything you do, or finding the best paths. Just progress, 1hr a day, every single day. .A painter doesn't get good after their first stick figure. They do tens of thousands of failed small attempts that build up to the occasionally solid large attempt. As they build up their skills from a ton of small, crappy projects, the eventually move onto more and more quality on each piece. Their skills don't manifest from perfecting their pain brush, getting the best pigments they can, or knowing absolutely everything they can about color theory. Don't worry about getting the best tutorial, learning Java perfectly, and being overwhelmed by all these new ideas. Just go through the first thing you see related to MC mods, that makes sense to you, and work up your skills, little by little.",Happiest-Soul,2025-11-26 03:38:21,6,learnprogramming,t3_1p63eza,False,

Postgres migrations, RLS rules, serverless functions, auth flows, environment variables across local and production, production/preview deployments, recreating the wheel instead of using battle tested code, running 2/3 projects in parallel, trying to get plugins to work together that don't offer api, customizations the whole stack… I touched all of it way before I “should have,” but it forced me to actually understand how systems fit together instead of just syntax.The wild part is I used to think feeling confused meant I wasn’t good enough. Now I realize even experienced devs get stuck. Half the job is debugging your own assumptions the other half is Googling or talking to an AI chatbot until the error finally makes sense.If I could go back I’d tell myself this early on: You don’t learn by memorizing you learn by building the thing that feels slightly too big for you and breaking it until you understand why it broke. Every time something failed in production or mis-configured itself or refused to link or deploy I came out understanding the system a little deeper.So yeah my advice is this: don’t be afraid to jump into the deep end.

You use it to create an object which looks like the class. Then you call the methods on that object. The reason you would want to do this is because you have multiple objects which are essentially the same, or similar. For example, take the ghosts in Pac-Man. You could write this by declaring X and Y co-ordinate variables for each ghost, but then you'd have a bunch of variables like ghost1x and ghost3y and ghost4x and so on. Think about how writing collision detection would work. You'd have to check if ghost1x==playerx && ghost1y==playery || ghost2x==playerx && ghost2y==playery.... nightmare.Instead, define a ghost class, and instantiate it four times, once for each ghost. The ghost class could include a collision detection function, to check if its *instantiation* hit the player.

The real way you learn OOP isn’t by studying diagrams, it’s by modeling small real systems, giving each class a clear responsibility, and avoiding the “giant class with 20 methods” trap. That shifts your thinking from: the procedural way: “What steps do I need to do?” to the OOP way: “What objects exist in this world, and what responsibilities do they have?”2. Tutorials don’t teach design, books do. If you want actual design and not just syntax, these beginner-friendly resources are gold: **""Head First Design Patterns""**: the best intro to OOP thinking, **""Practical Object-Oriented Design""**: very readable and extremely practical, and **""Refactoring improving design of existing code""**: not OOP-specific, but teaches you to *see* structure and smell bad design3. Another underrated tip: read good OOP code. Python libraries, open source github repositories, or even frameworks.4. On the language choice: Python can teach you OOP, but it’s a multi-paradigm language, so beginners often get mixed signals. If you want the concepts to crystallize faster, something more “pure OOP” like Java, C#, or Ruby tends to make the underlying principles way clearer.

It would benefit both to know how a combustion engine works, but knowing about catalytic converters doesn't make you drive faster, and knowing about racing lines doesn't help you fix cars.There's no ""wrong"" career path here, but software developers who know fuck all about CPUs are far more employable than computer scientists who can't code.

There are many (many, many) ways to accomplish this, so it's hard to give a good recommendation without it.I will recommend Python for the programming language, Flask for the web framework, and Waitress for the server. Python is about the simplest language to learn, Flask provides tools for building a web service in Python, and Waitress acts as a go-between to accept browser requests, turn them into calls to your program, and send the results back again. I would also recommend Flask-RESTful (I would structure the form submission as a REST API call). All of these have very good documentation.Note that as a security measure Waitress only responds to the 127.0.0.1 interface (your local-machine loopback) and cannot bind to ports under 1024, so you would usually bind to port 8000 or 8080. For local testing or demonstration this is quite sufficient; if you want to serve pages to other machines, you would usually install nginx as a reverse proxy.Your laptop very likely already has Python installed, but it is a good idea to make sure it is up to date. If you open a command-line window and run ""python -V"" it should respond with something like ""Python 3.12.3"". The current stable version is 3.14.0, and that is the one you should be running unless there is some specific reason you can't. (On Windows! On Mac or Linux, don't go monkeying with the system-provided version.)It is recommended to start by setting up a virtual environment, to prevent something you're adding from interfering with things you've already installed. You can do this by running ""python -m venv my_app"" followed by ""my_app\Scripts\activate"". You can now install the modules by running ""pip install Flask flask-restful waitress"" and start work.Check the Flask getting-started docs; it will walk you through writing a minimal web app. Use templates; you can probably drop most of your existing html code into template files and use it from there with minimal modification and without cluttering up your code. Check the Waitress docs; they will show you how to call your app and get it running. Try to keep everything as simple as possible until you get a minimal version up and running; you can always gild it later.Good luck! :four_leaf_clover:",Veterinarian_Scared,2025-11-23 05:10:26,1,learnprogramming,t3_1p46r8t,False,
nqcxls4,"For what you are asking to do, there isn't much special about a server.Your laptop is a PC and is perfectly capable of being both the server and the client for what you are proposing.There are lots of things you can do to make it more ubiquitous- for example if you could get a static IP allocated and have it added to a DNS, you could look it up from any computer using the network name (e.g. https://www.myserver.com/).But if you can't do that (the more likely scenario) you can just look up its dynamically allocated IP address and use that instead (e.g. https://1.2.3.4/ or whatever address you are assigned in place of 1.2.3.4).More importantly if you want people to access your server running on your laptop from another computer you will almost certainly need to open the port that the server is listening on.For example, let's say you setup a ""web site"" using apache tomcat on your laptop. Apache tomcat, by default listens on port 8080 (for unencrypted traffic and 8443 for https if memory serves). So, if you opened up your browser and entered http://localhost:8080/mystery, then assuming your web app is called ""mystery"" you should see the index.html (or index.jsp) of your site.Now if you determine that your IP is 1.2.3.4 (it won't be, but let's assume it is) you could go to another PC and enter http://1.2.3.4:8080/mystery then you will likely get a ""host refused connection"" error. This is because the firewall on your laptop isn't allowing anything from the outside to get through - unless you set up the firewall to allow external traffic using port 8080 (or 8443 if you want https) to get through...Note, if you do open any ports, only open the one or two that you allow and when you are done close them. In fact I would open them when I needed them to be open and close them once I've done the demo from the other computer.There are plenty of other potential things you may need to take into account. For example, it will be much easier if both computers are in the same ""subnet"". If you don't know what that means, then just connect to the same wifi AP and hope that the configurations are such that they connect to the same subnet (e.g. try not to use a professors laptop and your student laptop - this is unlikely to be an issue as it is unlikely that there will be such configuration issues, but you never know for sure unless you try it and know what to look for when it doesn't work on some computers ).",gm310509,2025-11-23 14:08:18,1,learnprogramming,t3_1p46r8t,False,

Start with just one type of hand, e.g. a flush.What's the definition of a flush? It's a hand where all the cards are the same suit.One possible way of doing it is to say: ""a hand is a flush if: it's all hearts, OR all clubs, OR all diamonds, OR all spades"". And then write code to check each of those four conditions. This approach will work but it's a bit tedious.If you think about it for a second, then it should be obvious that ""a hand where all cards are the same suit"" is equivalent to ""a hand where all cards have the same suit as the first card."" So you don't need to write four separate checks for the four possible suits.And so on. You can repeat this kind of analysis for each type of hand. For some of the hand types, you will need to examine multiple possibilities, e.g. for two pair, you'll need to check the different possible cards that might make up a pair. For a straight, you'll need to check whether there's a straight with aces low (5-4-3-2-A) or aces high (A-K-Q-J-10).There are many possible ways to implement this. If you're a beginner, I would suggest that you first focus on getting something that works *correctly*, even if it's ugly or verbose, and then look for ways to simplify and optimize it.

You will take a look at you two cards, check their suits, ignoring their value, then you'll take a look at the table to compare those card's suits to the ones that you have on hand, and IF total amount of cards with the same suit is 5 - you have a flush!

When you write a program, there are typically a lot of libraries with commonplace code you're using (iostream in C++ for example). If like, 4/5 programs on your computer are using iostream, it kinda makes no sense for each program to store it individually, right? That wastes a ton of space. The solution is dynamic library files (these are "".so"", or "".dll"" files). A dynamically linked program will be compiled in such a way that when it needs access to a library, it will access the compiled library code at run-time from the library file instead of having it baked into the executable. Of course, you could just bake the library code into the executable as well. That's static linking, and it's common when you're writing a program for a system with limited space. It also means your entire program is all in one piece.As for dynamic/static typing, that's talking about the data being read. All data has ""types"". Data can be an integer, an unsigned integer, a character, a boolean value, a floating point number, a double floating point number, etc. and all of those are stored & interpreted differently by the computer - as far as it's concerned, everything's just 1s and 0s. How does your compiler know which is which? Two solutions:1) You just tell the damn computer what you want. This is static typing. If you want ""i"" to be an ""int"", you fucking call it an ""int"", end of story.

nqeetna,"To add a little more detail, linking relates to calling methods. It’s something you barely think about while coding. You just call one, but how does that actually work? Code is also stored in memory at runtime and instructions have memory addresses (line number offsets from the start of the executable file). To call a method, you create a new stack frame for it on top of the stack, set a return pointer to hold the line you are currently on, then jump to the first line of the function you called. At the end of the function, you set a return variable in the caller’s stack frame and jump back using the return pointer. So, how do you know where to jump? If it’s a method in the same assembly, that’s easy. If it’s in another assembly, you have to determine the jump address. That’s linking. Assemblies have a table of jump addresses at their start so it’s possible to read and set these addresses. Static linkers set this at compile time and if the actual assembly used differs at runtime, interesting things can happen. Dynamic linkers use a runtime to load assemblies and will resolve these jump addresses at that point. Note that virtual methods that support polymorphism have an expanded table of jump addresses by concrete type since they can overload methods. The runtime selects the jump address based on the actual type at runtime. See v-tables for more information.Typing. All memory storage ultimately has a type. It has to since types are literally encoded differently and processed by different cpu components. You can choose to set that type yourself at compile time (statically) or let the runtime take its best guess (dynamic). The later is rarely necessary with objects in languages that support ad-hoc tuples (like js grab bag objects). With primitives or collections of primitives, it’s not a good practice. With types, you want strongly typed code that lets the compiler do as much validation for you as possible. Anything it doesn’t check can still break as an exception at runtime.",Far_Swordfish5729,2025-11-23 18:48:59,1,learnprogramming,t3_1p47j6y,False,

nq8rkx8,"at a high level, there are 2 types of embedded systems. I used to work on large unmanned systems, and we used stuff like PC104 computers with serial ports. The line of code you reference in your question would be an invocation of a library function, and that library function would talk to a driver, and that driver would send voltages out the USB port that produce the required signals to tell a motor to run or an actuator to move or the like, or it might read a camera video stream or a lidar or gps output. This is not much different from coding up a laptop or something, these computers had a full operating system and mouse/keyboard/monitor support for diagnostic efforts and so on. Its 'barely' embedded, in the big picture of that world, but we made many a 'robot' (mostly, unmanned aircraft and later, watercraft) with those tools. The other level is where you do more of that hands on, sometimes actually wiring devices together yourself and sending voltages to them with some agreed upon way, often directly setting an address to a value using a C or assembly like language. I did a lot less of that, as it is slower to produce the product and a lot more weeds to get into for each individual component. For example we had one 'smart' actuator that ran code, but you had to wire it up a certain way to accept a program and then wire it up a different way to run the program installed on it automatically when it got powered on. There was extensive documentation for making that work. I would start with a simulation. keep the stuff that would be hardware isolated so you can replace it, and build a sim where you drive your robot around and have it do the things you want it to do all in just pure desktop code. Then if you want to build it, you can pick out the hardware and change out the isolated code to interface with the motors and sensors and all. We had full simulation for all our vehicles, crude but it got the job done, to test our control systems and such safely in a virtual world.

Set a timer for that period of time, like 30min. When it stops, you stop. Add to that initial list of things you planned to research later.You won't memorize everything (and don't need to), and often times simply going through the main material, only learning enough to continue on with said material, will help you build a foundation to reinforce the rabbit holes you'd be digging through later. If you start with the rabbit hole first, then you may wind up with collapsed tunnels as you have nothing to tether that knowledge to.

Starting with only one painting that they focus all their quality on often stunts their progress compared to those who've done a healthy mix of both. You're focusing way too much on quality. Lean more towards quantity for now.Programming is solving problems by building solutions, like a trade. You need to build a lot of projects to get better at programming so you have something to tether theory to.

nr03d50,"> ... studying civil engineering, a degree in which you don't need to know anything about anything when it comes to coding.It might not be required or covered in your degree program, but if you plan to be a civil engineer and you know Python, I personally can't imagine why you ""wouldn't"" want to use Python to make your work easier/more enjoyable.Here's a quick Web search and I found this list of different Python libraries that could be used (assuming you don't try to build your own Python libraries, also a possibility): [GitHub - joreilly86/Python-Libraries-for-Engineers: A growing database of relevant Python libraries for Professional Engineers. Predominantly for Civil, Structural, Geotechnical and Mechanical. From flocode.dev.](https://github.com/joreilly86/Python-Libraries-for-Engineers)So just based on that list, glancing at it, although I personally know nothing about civil engineering, I would still say that it seems pretty useful, in the same way that knowing how to use a calculator is useful, even if your job is not mathematics per se.As for the other things you mentioned like freelancing doing ""data cleaning"" and ""scraping"", possibly you could do some work like that (but that kind of work is likely to be quite boring and mind numbing). I think sites like Upwork still have people looking for this kind of work getting done. I have no idea how lucrative it really is, though. I'd also be a bit weirded out/concerned about working with ""randos"" online like this.

It sounds like you are going for a Computer Science degree, and wondering, why they don't teach you to be a programmer, but a scientist. Maths (and DSA and all theoreetical CS courses) are very much required to become a computer scientist. You have to learn all of the basics, so you are able to specialize in any CS subfield later. This also enables you to understand, to have a common vocabulary and knowledge base with others, even if they have a different specialization. I spezialized in computer graphics at uni. One of my best friends in networking and distributed computing. Although we barely had any courses in common after the first 2 years, we could talk to each other and explain one another what we were doing and how it works, with barely any problems. Those skill are not immediately, obviously useful. But they are necessary for computer science. And as someone who was a tutor for a DSA course: Those courses are there to give you the toolkit to reason about algorithms, analyze them and even figure out new ones if you need to. They don't teach you how to program, and that's by design. It is a different skill. Programming on the other hand is something completely different. It is a craft. The program doesn't care if you know Dijkstras Algorithm, can integrate in multiple dimensions or know the difference between average and median. If helps to know those things about as much as a knowledge of a structural engineer helps you building wooden cabins. Good to have? Sure. Can you learn it quicker and easier for this specific usecase? Also yes. If you want to learn programming, you will either have to hope that your school has some courses in that direction that will be helpful, or you will have to take your foundational knowledge (like maths and DSA), get some tutorials and get programming. >Should I choose a specific field of software engineeringNot 100% sure, but it sounds like you really should focus on the fundamentals first>I tried to read books on software designagain, fundamentals. You are trying to run before you can walk.

An CLI that simulates how fast your money can grow with a 5% annual compound interest. Once you have that, a good next set of problems is the size of small games. Rebuilt Tetris. Flappy Bird.

In either case, you're going to have to have threads wait on each other to catch up before continuing.As for what ""synchronizing threads"" means, it means what it does on the tin. Threads don't run at consistent speeds, and they run independently of eachother. This means when you run two threads, the order they finish in can vary at run time, which can be bad if one relies on the result of the other to do its job. This can also result in two threads using the same resource at the same time, even when they shouldn't - imagine two people being able to book the same seat at a movie theatre because they both clicked ""book"" at the same time.To synchronize threads, you give them a way to communicate, and that's where Mutexes & Semephores come in.Mutexes are a shared resource that can either be ""locked"" or ""unlocked"" at any given time. If you wanna use it, you have to lock it so no one else can use it. You also have to unlock it before moving on lest you fuck everyone up.Semephores meanwhile are kind of like hall passes, where mutliple threads can use the semephore at the same time, up to a threshhold; useful less for strict ordering, and more making sure multiple types of thread (ones that involve heavy processing for example) aren't running at the same time, gumming everything up to a standstill.",DTux5249,2025-11-23 07:27:47,8,learnprogramming,t3_1p4ghgl,False,

The approach you take depends on the kind of app you’re testing. Selenium is a decent tool for developing and running functional tests in browsers.There’s regression testing. That’s generally a subset of functional testing, designed to test bugs you fixed last year to make sure they stayed fixed.There’s load testing, in which you run automated tests on your app using hundreds of virtual users. The point is to see what happens to your infrastructure when it falls over from overload. ApacheBench. JMeter.There’s penetration testing, in which you use tools to white-hat-hack your app or your servers or both to look for vulnerabilities. Burp Suite. Nmap.There’s static analysis, which automatically scans your source looking for security problems.Once you decide on which type(s) of testing you wanna talk about, your search engine is your friend.Beware: lots of the web content on this topic comes from companies that want to sell your CTO some *really* expensive stuff.",Aggressive_Ad_5454,2025-11-25 13:54:39,2,learnprogramming,t3_1p6ck3y,False,

nqihxb4,"Stick with Unity. Don't switch mid-project - that's just going to reset your learning curve back to zero and you'll lose all the time you've already invested.Here's the thing - what you're experiencing is completely normal. Unity has a steep learning curve at first, but once things click, they really click. I've made probably over 100 games throughout my career and I'm currently working on publishing my first Android game (using Capacitor, but I've done plenty in Unity too), so I've been exactly where you are.The good news is your plan is already solid - PC version first, VR later if time permits. That's the right approach. VR adds a whole extra layer of complexity, so definitely leave that for last or skip it entirely if you're running short on time.For the room generation part - break it down into smaller pieces. Start with just getting basic cubes or planes to represent walls and floor. Don't worry about materials and fancy stuff yet. Get the geometry working first, then add visual polish later. Unity's hierarchy system seems confusing at first but it's actually pretty straightforward once you realize it's just parent-child relationships.Three.js/Babylon.js might seem easier, but you're going to hit learning curves there too, and you'll have less community support, fewer tutorials, and way fewer assets available. Unity's ecosystem is massive, which means when you get stuck, someone has probably solved your exact problem already.My advice: keep pushing through with Unity. Focus on getting one piece working at a time. Room generation first, furniture placement second, VR dead last. You've already invested time learning Unity - switching now would be starting from scratch with a different set of problems.Also, fair warning - you'll probably hit another wall when you're around 80-90% done. That's when all the edge cases, polish, and ""last 10%"" stuff becomes way harder than you expect. When you get stuck (and you will), the Unity community is really helpful. Unity Forums and Stack Overflow are great for specific technical problems. The Unity subreddit (r/Unity3D) is good for broader ""how should I approach this"" questions.One more thing - if you haven't already, check out Unity's official video tutorials, especially the ones relevant to 3D environments and UI.

Add membership management (sign up/sign on), add payments and subscriptions, add SMS and email reminders, add calendar scheduling. Unit test this and deploy it using CI/CD pipelines.The idea is to take any project you are working on and add the works to it so you learn and it guides you through your learning like a roadmap.

No direct CRUD on tables must be permitted.This protects your data from badly written/optimised/long-running queries, unauthorized modification, etc without having to write a separate server application and inventing its own protocol.A client application should still handle disconnects, failed transactions and error messages from the RDBMS as appropriate for the situation.

Learning a little bit of cloud and DevOps wouldn’t hurt either, it’s pretty expected these days. So learn the basis of Azure, AWS, or GCP to the standard that a dev is expected to. You don’t need to go super into the weeds, but get an understanding of CICD Pipelines, Kubernetes, Docker, etc.This is pretty much the bare minimum knowledge for devs with a few years experience nowadays at least for web devs.Do that then study some system design methods (neetcode has videos for it as well as leetcode) and a few DSA questions. Don’t go too overboard on it though like many here will, if you aren’t trying to crack Big Tech, a good chunk of companies don’t even ask leetcode.From there just apply and hope for the best, the market is as good as it was 3-4 years ago.Edit:Biggest thing is probably to not ask this sub for advice, it’s full of unemployed people, students, and sky is falling doomers that can’t see what their weaknesses are",kingofthesqueal,2025-11-23 17:04:30,11,cscareerquestions,t3_1p448bb,False,

(see [https://epoch.ai/blog/predicting-gpu-performance](https://epoch.ai/blog/predicting-gpu-performance) for what I'm talking about)* Neural scaling laws which model performance are inherently increasing BUT concave down when more parameters/data are added, meaning that improvements should continue to get smaller over time; and this is not just the case for LLMs, but for any AI that could exist.On top of that, there's reason to believe that the models may get worse. Much of the data now on the internet is AI-generated and it is inevitable that a great deal of it will be used to train new LLM models, thereby causing them to overfit and degrade somewhat. Let's also not forget that the CEOs and researchers have a lot to gain by hyping up AI, so if that is what is causing to feel concerned, try to not to let it get to you; there's a long history of this kind of stuff happening when relatively new technologies emerge, but the end result has always been exaggerations.",EntranceOrganic564,2025-11-24 17:15:16,15,cscareerquestions,t3_1p5lq1p,False,

The approval process to get new tech is a pain. Bureaucracy slows down initiatives, you’ll figure out “work arounds” that’ll help you continue to work when waiting for permits or approvals. For example, maybe using localstack to build a POC because your new AWS feature isn’t approved yet3) tech debt… classic right?

For a senior level role, I would expect a lot of interviews to focus on strong system design (differs a bit between backend and frontend though). If you're targeting big tech, you're likely going to encounter some form of algorithm interview rounds. And of course, prepare for your standard behavioral questions as needed. A lot of times, these boil down how you resolve inter-personal issues of deadlines, disagreements, prioritization, etc.Outside of technical skills though, linkedin premium is probably a good place to start, though you might want to only use it for 2-3 months and decide from there if you still need it. I also think the primary thing to focus on is applying to listings early. Another side note for linkedin is to reply to recruiters if they do reach out, even if you are declining them.

Questions could include what sort of architecture issues it had and how you solved them, working across team/org and what your approach was, what could have gone better, what you learned, all that sort of thing. They will also be checking to see that you had sufficient senior level scope - eg you led the design and leadership of the project.

That being said, people that have skills are looking for a job for a handful of months.

Get work experience while in school. I worked in tech support, then as a QA while I was still in school. I then proceeded into QA automation until I finished school and started my first full time software engineering job. Now is a great time to pick up a job in an adjacent field until you have more experience to get into a team as a software engineer.As far as AI is concerned, I love it as a tool and am looking for ways that our team can effectively adopt it into our coding practices, but it's not the magic wand some people love to say it is. It can help speed up development of ""boilerplate code"" that is tailored to a specific purpose or to help get answers to a new codebase. The demos where someone creates a web app or phone app just by prompting is great for creating a prototype to get feedback from the market on whether its worth spending engineering time to actually develop that feature. The code generated may be useful enough to build off of, but as a codebase grows in complexity, the likelihood of using any large amount of AI-generated code becomes increasingly difficult.",Acrodemocide,2025-11-24 01:37:10,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1p51uru,False,

nr1r3bt,"So, broadly speaking, disagreeing is perfectly normal and in fact is strongly encouraged in healthy teams. Crucially though, both parties have to be disagreeing in a spirit of honest inquiry. They have to be listening to what the other person is saying and understanding why they have said it. In a properly functioning disagreement you will be asking as many questions as you will be giving answers.Eventually, you might get to a point where you both fully understand each other, but do just fundamentally disagree. At this point, you will typically involve a 3rd party (another colleague, a team lead) to give a fresh perspective, and to act as a tie-breaker. If you still can't come to a consensus after that, then your only option is to disagree and commit. A senior decision maker (e.g. a team lead) will pick one of the options, and you will all agree that, even if it's not your preferred option, you will commit to getting it done on the basis that doing the wrong thing well is often better than not doing anything at all.Key rules when disagreeing:1. Authority is irrelevant. If you can't explain and justify your view, your job title of Fancypants Principal Senior Architect is meaningless.2. Listen. Listen and understand what the other person is saying. Ask clarifying questions or suggest concrete examples if you don't.3. Go for a beer afterwards. This is the importance of relationships. I can have (sometimes quite forceful) disagreements with colleagues, but it is fine because we are also friendly with each other. Grab a beer, or a coffee, or have a game of pool, or whatever, but just build that relationship so it can easily survive disagreements.Finally, YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) is a common approach in software development, and it has it's place, but when it comes to security concerns you _are_ going to need it!",HiddenStoat,2025-11-27 13:11:35,8,cscareerquestions,t3_1p807h5,False,

By that point you would have narrowed down what are the topics that you need to improve on and it really honed your skills with interviewing. The best part is that those interviews that you practice with won't be held against you because you'll be applying to completely different jobs in the next 6 months.

nqdekb4,"TLDR: Don’t move for less than 300-400k, Consider moving within Canada first. Canadian SWE (6 yoe) current living and working in NYC. From my opinion, it’s only really worth it if you can make significantly high salary, such that you can buy your way out of American problems. This is significantly harder for someone with a family, as your expenses will be higher and you will be impacted by more specific issues than someone who is single (Schools, Health care costs, etc). Even in a lower cost region like Baltimore, I wouldn’t move for anything less than 100-300% salary increase over your Canadian salary. If you’re really committed to this - Don’t focus on the L1-B visa, Consider TN. Apply externally to jobs in cities with tech hubs (SF, NYC, Seattle). With your YOE you should be able to get some decent high paying jobs (200k-400k). These should pay enough for you to support your family with 1 income; so even if your spouse can’t secure a visa, it’s still manageable. - Plan for potential private school expenses. Public education varies based on where you live, so either plan on paying more rent in a high income area or paying for private. - Plan for a short stay. Both L1B and TN are employer tied. So you WILL (not maybe) eventually find yourself having to come back to canada quickly if your employment ends. - The tech market is tough right now, but from what I’ve seen it’s still pretty competitive for senior level roles. Tbh, Consider moving within Canada. There are definitely senior level jobs in Canada that pay way more than 100k, you may just have to move to Toronto or Vancouver.

By the hours, the masters gave me an extra year of work, all of which is geared towards personal development.As for getting into AI/ML labs, that's probably much harder, unless you do specific research that has industry overlap.

nr63g6w,"For ML engineering, I think Masters helps with that. But plenty of people get an MLE job even without a masters. MLE from what I gather is, SWE in the context of ML. There is an additional interview round for MLE jobs where they ask you ML trivia like ""what it is the difference between L1 and L2 normalization"" or ""Explain K-fold cross validation"". You may or may not get to do model development in an MLE job. But you will be involved in productionalizing an already developed model.For applied scientists type of a role though. I have seen a few of my batch mates get those type of roles with just a master's degree. There are a few caveats though.1. These roles were in Amazon. In Amazon Applied scientist role is more of a SWE role than an AS role from what I observed. Most of the Amazon Applied Scientist roles are not the same as Microsoft research Applied Scientist role or Google Brain Research scientist or even Facebook AI research applied scientist roles. A lot of Amazon AS people get to churn out research papers every year. But I have seen even MLEs churn out research papers as well.2. You need to have at least 1 publication even for the Amazon AS role, when applying from outside. A thesis in the Master's program helps with that.3. The school I attended was a top 20 school for CS back when I was applying. And a few of my Batchmates are now working as Applied scientists in Facebook and Amazon without a Ph.D with just a master's degree. And these were people on H1b. Not even US citizens. Your experience might not be the same however.Also applied scientist interviews are far more mathematical in nature than SWE/MLE interviews. You go into an interview and they might ask you to derive the expected value of a normal distribution or something on a whiteboard. A math heavy master's program from a top US university definitely helps with cracking that type of an interview.",Sad_Work_2166,2025-11-28 04:48:29,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1p8iauk,False,

nqfyuz4,A lot of these aren’t actually really issues but can be if you don’t communicate them. Over 10 years ago I was in the same spot not knowing what to do. Today I still frequently get into these spots. The difference between me back then and now is I communicate much better and know how to learn. Delays? You know beforehand and you call them out when you see them coming. Giving stakeholders a heads up is good. No heads up when people are counting on you is really bad.In general though it sounds like you just need to spend some time so be sure to get AI to summarize docs for you and help you with coding as well. This will limit the number of surprises but surprises always happen. If you never hit surprises then the scope of your work isn’t big enough for you and you’re ready for more challenging work. Not communicating changes in assumptions and no requirements that were found would be a problem but people will give some leeway to new developments that were discovered. Prod issues? Everyone makes these mistakes. I caused one a few months back and even the most senior members of my team have done this too. Again if you haven’t done this then you haven’t worked enough or the scope of your work is too little. It happens to everyone. For these take charge and learn from them. Everyone makes these mistakes and can learn from them. I’m a manager turned IC again and I can say this: you want a good relationship with your manager too so play the political game. The manager is generally on your side because if you do well so does the manager. A lot of these issues can be communicated with the manager to help unblock you. Can’t give estimates right away? Yeah no one really can unless they’re super familiar with the subject matter. When your work becomes more ambiguous as your level goes up these can be more difficult.

Split the monster PR into small slices with contract tests; pair each with a Flyway/Liquibase migration and rollback.I’ve used Hasura for fast read models on Postgres, Kong to centralize auth/rate limits on legacy endpoints, and DreamFactory to auto‑generate REST on ugly SQL so the frontend stops hand‑rolled queries.If leadership won’t allow flags, canary, and sign‑offs, start interviewing.Bottom line: document and gate the risks, ship behind flags with observability, and make incremental fixes instead of another big hack.",Adventurous-Date9971,2025-11-27 17:53:26,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1p82f1v,False,
