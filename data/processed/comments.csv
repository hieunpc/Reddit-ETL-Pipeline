Beyond just practicing SQL syntax, focus on these data engineering-specific concepts for Shopify:1.​Performance thinking: When you write queries during the assessment, always consider ""how would this perform on millions of rows?"" Shopify deals with massive scale. Use EXPLAIN plans, avoid SELECT *, and think about index usage.2. ​Data quality patterns: Practice SQL for data validation, deduplication (ROW_NUMBER() OVER PARTITION BY), and identifying data anomalies. Real data engineering involves catching bad data before it breaks pipelines.3. ​Incremental processing: Since you mentioned building pipelines mostly in Python, practice SQL patterns for incremental loads—using timestamps, watermarks, and merge/upsert logic. Think ""how do I process only new/changed data efficiently?""4.​Set-based thinking: Coming from Python, you might be used to loops. SQL is set-based. Practice writing queries that transform entire datasets at once rather than row-by-row logic.5. ​Real-world scenarios: Go beyond LeetCode. Practice queries like: ​Detecting duplicate orders ​Calculating running totals/moving averages ​Handling NULL values and edge cases ​Transforming nested/JSON data​For Shopify specifically: They care about how you communicate your approach.

To use your examples; If I break up the CSV putting each row in it's own message, process each row one at a time, and one fails, that row fails, not the whole CSV. That way I know exactly where the problem is and my users have access to the data that is not wrong while the issue with the failures gets handled. Slapping a CDC implementation gives me a stream of all the changes to the relational database not just the end state when the incremental job ran. If the load drastically increases the streaming system gives me a buffer without having to scale my workers unless the load sustains past my data latency requirements. I've seen incremental jobs like that lock up a worker using all the memory because it was suddenly getting back much more from querying the relational database than it had been designed to handle. It couldn't process anything until those workers got scaled up.Second, I think you pointed out something with the fact that you're doing streaming on one system and batch on another. You now effectively have two different types of systems you're maintaining. If you go Kappa architecture as opposed to Lambda architecture you only have one type of system and that simplifies your operational overhead. Even if streaming is harder to operate, you end up ahead. I've never personally found a streaming system more operationally difficult but people do. If you're only going to have one kind of system, I think it's easier to put a batch of work on a streaming system than to try and micro-batch your way to approximating a streaming system.Lastly, and this is more personal, I like to think of data pipelines in a functional programming or even unix shell scripting model.

Warehouses and data lakes - Azure ADLS, Amazon S3, Redshift, etc.They all store data, but for different purposes. RDBMS systems are used for storing application data that gets read and updated by users all the time (think of user profiles, posts, comments to posts, orders, etc.), and these store data in relational row-based form under the hood, and have their own internal mechanisms for data processing related to application business logic, constraint and transaction enforcement (OLTP for application data).NoSQL systems also store application business data, they're preferred in the use cases where RDBMS' strict constraint, transaction, schema enforcement and strong consistency become a bottleneck - mainly, data partitioning. It's a big and complex topic to explain in one sentence, but generally speaking, NoSQL systems sacrifice those perks to some degree to achieve native and easy horizontal scalability across multiple servers in a cluster (don't confuse with read replicas), which is a tradeoff that's OK for many modern use cases.Warehouses and data lakes is where that application data later lands to from the main database(s), for the purposes of analytical workloads, BI, AI/ML (OLAP workloads). The reason data is placed in a different place for these workloads is because it needs to be organized differently under the hood to be efficiently queried for these purposes (keywords to look up - columnar data format, parquet, OLAP) - while application database needs to be fast for lots of small individual writes and reads per row, warehouses need to be very fast at batch querying, big scans and throughput. And Spark is a data processing tool, that does distributed processing for warehouses and data lakes, not for OLTP workloads. Also to keep in mind, if your data is not that big and you can process it on one server without any problem, you don't need Spark, a custom Python script using e.g. Pandas dataframes for transformations will do the job without the overhead of setting up a cluster.",Inevitable_Zebra_0,2026-01-29 19:10:58,5,dataengineering,t3_1qq9o22,False,

o2kvrao,">What's the motivation to still pursue this field ?As somebody who went into this field from a different field, if you work in IT/programming, don't suck at it, and work for a decent company, GOOD LORD is it a sweet deal.Life as a chemist:* There is no such thing as remote work. You are on-site 100% of the time. I used to have to commute 1.5 hours one way if it was a quick journey. Made me give up all of my hobbies post work. Standard working day was around 12 hours (wake up at 6, get home at around 6). Yeah, I could have moved closer but I'm glad I didn't because it meant I'd have moved to bum fuck nowhere for a job which ended my contract during the pandemic* Labs are often in shitty locations. Good luck if you want to live near a city and have a reasonable commute time. Didn't pack a lunch? Budget 20 minutes of your lunch time getting to and from somewhere to get something to eat* People think lab work is a refined art where people stand around in pristine labs and discuss how the universe works. In reality, the labs are freezing cold in winter, swelteringly hot in summer, and poorly maintained. Half of me isn't surprised because if there is an explosion/fire, it's not a huge amount of damage cost.* No windows can be quite common in buildings. Somewhere I used to work, during winter there were days I'd see no natural light (get in before sun rise, sun sets at around 4 pm)* It's also a lot more physical than people give credit for. Lifting large/heavy vessels into/out of your fume cupboard as well as transporting large quantities of materials isn't easy on your back as you get older* I worked in organic synthesis where if you don't have a PhD in chemistry, it's incredibly hard to not only break into the field but succeed because you're talking about the vast majority of people have a PhD, thus use it as a stick to beat you with (quite fairly, tbh). I do not have a PhD and was usually the only person in the lab who didn't have a PhD* The work environment is a lot less forgiving than tech. You can't google and hit the right answer easily. You really have to know what you are asking the internet. Even then, the answers are likely not widely published. People are a lot smarter on average and a lot less willing to accept bullshit answers* Salaries are not remotely comparable although you do get a much better pension. For reference, I used the chemical companies used to pretty much double your contributions. I have never seen that figure in ITLife as a DE:* Work from home is an option. If you have to turn up, at least your office is likely somewhere accessible and temperature controlled* A much lower barrier to entry. The idea you ""need"" a Masters degree is, in my opinion, complete bollocks. DE education requirements are not standardised across the industry whereas chemistry absolutely is. It's not possible to get into chemistry without a chemistry degree, although you can definitely get into data without a CS degree* Difficulty isn't anywhere near as close. If I ruin a reaction in the lab, good luck getting that shit back. I guess it's like dropping a DB without a back up, although it's much easier to back something up than it is to make an extra X amount of material in case, I don't know, you drop your flask on the floor, somebody knocks it over etc. You live in a world of glass so breakages are inevitable* General working is a lot easier. Synthesis of a product can take a long time. A long one is multiple days if not weeks. You can turn something around quickly and have almost unlimited tries at it in DE* Stakes being lower means it's not as stressful although it does mean you get a lot more bozos because people are less careful. The introduction of AI has massively exposed who is and isn't a fraud (anybody who struggles without AI or ""has to"" lie on their CV is absolutely a fraud)* Zero manual labour. Much much lower chances of dying - I used to make novel pharmaceutical compounds which were definitely biologically active although since it has never been made or tested before (publicly), nobody has any idea how toxic the compound is. So, it could either do nothing or murder you on the spot. Fun fact: I once made something which was over 30 times more potent than fentanyl* Salaries are way higher on average. After 2-3 years of being in DE, I earnt double what I did as my final salary as a chemist after around 10 years in the industrySo what I'm saying is life is relative. If you have only ever worked in tech, then yeah, the grass will always seem greener.

At that point you are building a DSL inside YAML, and nobody wants to debug YAML on friday.The happy middle ground is metadtaa drives ingestion and standard bronze/silver handling.

You want to have a happy path defined that follows SWE practices but via your custom DSLs allows to onboard more things. Not just ingestion- also transformations and BI and AI stuff. Further this has to be grounded in the accompanying infrastructure. And last but certainly not least data governance and IAM need additional metadata for perhaps PII data and DQ checks.

I don’t know if its right - only time will tell:-1 - get really good a defining and documenting for AI and business. How do I get an Agent to accelerate my work via context and not code. How do I show others the value I’m generating via acceleration of skills and effect using LLMs. Outcomes are all that count - 99% success but no value to business or customers doesn’t count as a win. 2 - the technology moats will come down. Oracle tech stack isn’t going to be a thing in 2 years. You’re a plumber of data and the stack/implementations matter less as the coast of replacing them is coming down at a huge rate. Tech debt suddenly has way lower interests rates. 3 - get good at big data again. Small stuff is gonna be usurped - that’s light work for a LLM. Big data is going to be hard because of cost and time. Start with YouTube - it’s a mess of influencers and hype men but there is some gold in there. Microsoft have a bunch of free GitHub learning on AI, ML, Big data on their repos. https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners is one. But they gave many. One thing to remember - the AI coding hype cycle has been around for 2 or so years of any value. You are still smarter than AI for sure. It can just type and think faster than you. So figure out how to make it your puppet, you will win. You WILL have an aha moment after 2-3 months and it will kick in.

So 99% of the time marketing analytics involves validating someone's decision rather than a hypothesis. As in, someone has already made up their mind about what they want to do, they just need to prove that it was the right decision in hindsight.",TheGrapez,2026-01-31 20:09:06,23,dataengineering,t3_1qscp60,False,

FP&A in my experience is awful because you get a bunch of excel jockeys who think that because they can maintain a rats nest of insane excel macros and formulas that they know how to “do data engineering”.

It's easy to say they're always blaming others but let's be real, without them the company would earn way less and you wouldn't have a job there. So let's make their work as easy as possible.\- EVERYONE in their team should be aware of your current data infrastructure + its limitations. They should know your roadmap/sprint board/whatever, so they don't think you're sitting on your asses and do nothing. \- If they have recurring issues, create a ticket, let them follow it. Whenever they try to blame, ask them to tell their lead to discuss with your data lead to prioritize it. If your lead declines, they won't annoy you because they know why they don't get it. \- Block urgent ad-hoc requests. Every request has to be a ticket with a clear description + impact + what happens if they don't have it within the next . With the last question a lot of urgent things will not be urgent anymore. Most of the time it's just a blocker they want to get rid off asap. \- Sometimes they actually don't have the data to do their jobs. Can you provide an interim solution by pulling raw data without implementing it into your data model? So they can run simple queries.Know your people, try to be seen as an overworked ally who wants to unblock them.

o354spa,"I work in Marketing Operations, and I find the challenges I deal with day-to-day are underestimated by management.1. I often find that I don’t have the data to do what is being asked of me. Most commonly, this happens when there is a campaign where the target audience is brand new. I cannot tell you how many times I find myself caught in email chains with compliance and legal where their segmentation criteria requirements specify data points that the company does not even have and has no way of obtaining in a timely or reasonable way. Many times, I will point this out to my superiors who will just ignore me and leave me to figure it out on my own because they have no idea what to do. This literally happened to me last quarter. :zany_face: I work closely with the team that does operational comms, and it is similarly stressful because they do not always know what list criteria they will need or when. They often deal with Sudoku like puzzles where they have to build lists with pieces of information, from multiple applications and then find a method to validate the results.Even coordinating sends becomes challenging because of how dynamic the production process is. Multiple rounds of revisions means delayed approval which can push past the expected send date, causing sending conflicts that now have to be sorted out with multiple teams that often believe their message should be priority.2. Yes. “Everything is a fire.” :fire: Things break unexpectedly all the time, and we are constantly conducting an orchestra in front of a live audience. Marketing comes to you complaining of “bad” data, but keep in mind that often we are fielding complaints from our stakeholders, triggering the inquiry. (FWIW Typically, I only flag anomalies after multiple observations or complaints. I also do some initial investigating on my end, like reviewing audit and sync error logs to rule out the obvious.)Successfully capturing UTM parameters is kind of like walking a tightrope if you have a bloated tech stack and duplicate records. Yes, collection CAN be the issue, but I’m 15 years into a career as an IC in digital marketing now, and I mostly pull my hair out from poor data practices upstream in the CRM (e.g; users deleting emails and creating a new record, duplicates merged where UTMs aren’t preserved, poor field level security or outdated/inappropriate user permissions, etc.) I’ve had an experience just in the last few years where the internal IT team decided to pull Marketing’s access to the native UTM fields (after 8+ years of having access) because a newer and more senior product hire had this as a requirement. It broke all of the UTM tracking from the website and some other applications, and I had to spend a year arguing with them to get it fixed :face_with_rolling_eyes:The practices I see in Salesforce in the last 5 years truly feel like a major regression from the ways that I learned to manage data and technology early on in my career. I worked for leaders that mentored me in [customer driven enterprise architecture](https://blog.opengroup.org/2021/01/28/providing-customer-driven-value-with-a-togaf-based-enterprise-architecture/). It feels like it’s become a foreign concept with what I see now. For example, I have worked for multiple orgs that will spend a good month if not more in between December and January completely caught up in territories, sales compensation and incentives, performance reviews and bonuses, etc. Entire calendars are blocked off and dedicated completely to the sales process and sales experience. I’ve seen how entire companies are stalled as they wait for decisions to be made. Lastly, sometimes we work for people that will use their authority to put pressure on us or our managers to force us to do things we know are stupid. :face_with_rolling_eyes::woman_facepalming_medium-light_skin_tone: It’s riskier to say this if you work remotely, but when I worked in person, it’s the kind of thing I absolutely would’ve acknowledged in a whisper :shushing_face:",girlgonevegan,2026-02-02 12:07:13,1,dataengineering,t3_1qscp60,False,

o2fm7bs,"Hi, a few things to consider.\- Data Talks Zoom Camp uses GCP, whereas Data Engineering by Joe Reis uses AWS. Even though the cloud technology you use doesn't matter much to learn the concepts, it's still better to start with what you are interested in. \- Zoom Camp is semi-structured and felt all over the place with some GitHub content, YouTube videos, past Cohort links, etc. For someone like me, it's very easy to deviate and lose interest. \- Joe Reis's course is well structured with a lot of optional material and paired with the Fundamentals of Data Engineering as the course's textbook. The assignments follow a similar structure to other Andrew NG's courses. Not too tough to pass. But, still a lot to explore and learn. \- ZoomCamp is free but uses a sponsored orchestrator. The deeplearning course uses Airflow, which is considered standard. Of course, there is Dagster and a few other tools gaining traction. So, this is not too significant either. \- ZoomCamp is tweaked and updated every year. But the DeepLearning course stays the same. But since it's a very recent release, it still covers the most popular tools and concepts, such as Lakehouse architecture, dbt, text data processing for AIML workloads, etc. \- ZoomCamp has a strict deadline to get the certificate. You will still achieve it if you start now. I assume the score weightage is mostly on the capstone project. For the Deep Learning one, you can keep paying and extending as long as needed.Overall, I tried to finish Zoomcamp multiple times and was distracted, but I am in the final module of the Deep Learning course.",mothikikm,2026-01-29 16:15:20,5,dataengineering,t3_1qq4aw3,False,

Some of the others are less so, but overall it's pretty solid. I'm half way through Joe Reis's Deeplearning and I'm torn on whether to finish it or not. A lot of the videos are reiterating a lot of content from his book (Fundamentals of Data Engineering). It goes over a lot of the soft skills that a good DE needs, but less so on the technical side. His class spends a lot of time within AWS and you do pick up some skills with it, so it's not too bad, but I don't feel like it was sticking with me after the class was done.Personally, do a few of the DataTalks zoomcamps - it has you writing and doing more than the other courses. And since the zoomcamps can occasionally miss some steps, it will force you to either interact with the other students or hone your research skills in order to make things work correctly.Lastly, you can go back through the DataTalks github and look at previous cohorts - they change up their tech stack some.

o34iw9k,"Couple things from someone who was in a very similar “I like cloud + data but entry level feels impossible” spot:First, your background is actually a plus. Biomedical + CS + interest in AWS is a really solid combo for any company doing healthcare / medtech / clinical analytics. You’re not “just another CS grad” and you should lean into that in your branding.Job search stuff:You’re not going to win by only applying through LinkedIn / Indeed. Use them to find roles, but assume most of your “wins” will come from:- Direct company career pages (especially mid‑sized boring‑sounding companies, not just the big names)- Alumni network from your undergrad and your MS program- Local meetups / online meetups (data engineering, cloud, healthcare analytics)On LinkedIn specifically:Search for “data engineer”, filter by Experience → Entry level / Associate, and also try “analytics engineer” and “data analyst” with SQL + Python + cloud. A lot of “data engineer” work is hiding under those titles and is more friendly to juniors.Then for roles you like:Check who works there as a data engineer / analytics engineer / dev on LinkedIn. Add them with a short note like:“Hey, saw you work on X at Y. I’m a biomedical eng + CS grad student getting into data engineering (SQL/Python/AWS, a few personal projects). Would love to ask 2–3 quick questions about how you got started there if you have time.”You’re not asking for a job, you’re asking for info. Some % of those chats naturally turn into referrals.Targeting-wise, with your background I’d look at:Health tech startups, EHR vendors, medical device companies, hospital systems, insurers, pharma / biotech. They all have messy data and love someone who actually understands the domain.Also, consider “bridge” roles:Data analyst, BI dev, “reporting engineer,” even some backend roles with a data flavor. If they let you work with SQL, warehouses, ETL, and AWS, that’s a path into a pure DE title later. First job title matters less than “I have 1–2 years of real data work on my resume.”Projects:Make 2–3 small but real projects that scream “I can do data engineering” and “I know healthcare”.Example: pull some public health dataset, build a basic pipeline:ingest → clean → store → query → simple dashboard.Put it on GitHub, write a 1‑page README that explains the problem, tech stack, and what you did. This is gold in interviews.If you want to play with realistic internal‑tool type stuff: spin up a small web UI on top of that data so someone non‑technical could view / edit it. Tools like uibakery / Retool / Appsmith are handy for this, because you can show “I know how to wire APIs + DB + UI together” without spending months learning frontend. That’s closer to what a lot of internal data teams actually do.Mindset part:The “no light at the end of the tunnel” feeling is super normal. Most people don’t talk about the 200 ignored applications, just the 1 offer. If you’re sending out apps into a void with no feedback, shift some of that time into:- Reaching out to humans- Tightening 1–2 standout projects- Practicing SQL + basic data modeling + simple dbt / Airflow patterns so you crush technical screensYou’re not incapable. The market is just noisy and bad at surfacing juniors. Your combo of domain + CS + cloud interest is good.

Not a complete solution. You do not do a course and become a complete programmer in the same way graduating with a medicine degree makes you ready to carry out complex, life threatening surgery.A common misconception is that all you need is a course. Personally, I did an online courses. I did a few actually. 6-8 months later, I got my first DE role with no experience whatsoever. Without any further detail, this makes getting into DE sound really fucking easy.What isn't included is all of the work outside of those courses. I was literally writing code, watching videos, reading blogs, writing stuff down, and generally thinking about programming for 60-70 hours per week every week for around 6 months. And when I say writing code, I wasn't following tutorials. I was googling the fuck out of the internet on how to try and do what I wanted to do. As you can tell, that's a lot more than 70-90 hours.On top of that, what's also not mentioned is my career before being in DE involved interpreting data on pretty much a daily basis. Sometimes, stuff which you can't even measure, test, or see.

Of course it does.That being said, you are only wasting your time if you think the course is ""enough"". There are lot of soft skills which you can't really measure and they are a lot more valuable than the degree itself. You have the massive benefit of not being time gated with what and how you learn which is balanced against not having a traditional degree.My recommendation is work very heavily on your soft skills.

For da ad hoc querying from api and then analyzing data in notebook, Pandas (or better these days to future proof yourself, Polars) is more likely to be a go to. It is a discreet analysis engine. It is great for flattening api json to tables quickly, it is modular so you can do step wise analysis, it is very quick to export from.But for proper oltp or olap based de pipeline dev with traceability and db centric design, sql will be your bread and butter much of the time. I have moved from da to de and have been using more and more duckdb as my sql engine lately. It is olap so it doesn't have schema registration reqs as ready to enforce, but it can lazy process parquet from s3 VERY efficiently without significant memory required. The thing about pandas is that all ops are in memory, which is fine if your dataset is less than your available system RAM, but when you work with larger data or cloud based flows (and associated costs) limiting memory dependency is an important optimization. Polars also can help with this because it has lazy loading ops.At this point for data collection i pull from api and collect as polars then pass to duck to write raw data as partitioned parquet. If I can do transformations in duck I do it all in duck directly querying the parquet. If there is something messy that I have difficulty doing in duck, I will do what I can with duck and then take it back to polars for lazy in memory vector ops. If I need to quickly inspect data I use pandas converted tables because I am more well versed on pandas. I also use pandas where iteration line by line is necessary (like api lookup). Ultimately I will typically then write processed flattened consumable data as partitioned parquet.

It helped me. ```When (and only when) the user is asking a technical / software-engineering-related question (coding, debugging, architecture, tooling, infra, performance, data, etc.), follow the Technical Coaching Policy below. For non-technical questions, respond normally.PRIMARY OBJECTIVE (highest priority)Maximise the user’s learning through their own thinking and decisions. Be a force multiplier for skill and clarity—never a replacement for reasoning. Success is defined by the user understanding and being able to do it themselves.OPERATING MODES (stateful; affects technical questions only)- COACH mode (default): You guide and scaffold; you do not deliver full solutions.- DIRECT mode: You may answer normally (including complete solutions/code).MODE SWITCH COMMANDS- Switch to DIRECT mode when the user’s most recent message contains: FORCE_ANSWER- Switch to COACH mode when the user’s most recent message contains: RESET_COACH- If both appear in the same message, the command that appears last (latest position in the message text) wins.- Treat these as literal, case-sensitive substrings.- When a mode switch happens, do NOT require the user to restate their question. Proceed to answer the same message in the newly selected mode (ignoring the command text as part of the “question”).SCOPE: WHAT TO COACH VS WHAT TO ANSWER DIRECTLY (in COACH mode)- Coaching rules apply to: debugging, implementation, architecture, system design, algorithm choice, performance work, refactors, “why is this failing?”, “how do I build X?”.- Direct answers are allowed for pure reference/lookup: syntax, flags, API names, definitions, small factual recall (act like a fast search engine). Optionally add a brief pointer to context only if helpful.COACH MODE RULES (default)1) Do NOT provide end-to-end solutions. - No complete working code that solves the user’s specific task. - No “recipe” that substitutes for the user’s key reasoning. - No copy-paste “fixed version” of their program.2) Keep the user driving the process. Prefer questions first, but you may steer (measuredly). - Clarify: goal, constraints, environment, expected vs actual, what they tried, minimal reproduction. - Ask for evidence: exact errors, logs, inputs, versions, failing tests, timing, stack traces. - Help them form and test hypotheses: “If X were true, we’d observe Y—can you check?”3) Provide high-leverage guidance. - Offer mental models, tradeoffs, and “what to look up” keywords. - Suggest divide-and-conquer debugging: reduce the case, bisect changes, isolate dependencies, add instrumentation, check invariants, write a targeted test, compare known-good vs failing paths. - You may validate/invalidate hypotheses with brief reasoning and a concrete verification step.4) Code policy (allowed, but cautious) - Small snippets are allowed only as scaffolding: illustrative examples, minimal patterns, function signatures, partial skeletons, pseudocode, TODO holes. - Snippets must not be the full solution to the user’s stated problem. - Escalate snippet specificity only when necessary and only after the user has attempted steps and reported back.5) Progressive disclosure (escalation) - Start with the minimum effective hint(s) + 1–3 concrete next checks. - If the user returns with results, escalate: more targeted questions, sharper hypotheses, slightly more concrete skeletons—still no full solution in COACH mode.6) Communication style - Be concise and actionable. - Prefer a short plan + next step(s) + what to report back. - Do not restate these policies unless asked; just operate this way.DIRECT MODE RULES- Answer the user normally and directly, including complete implementations if requested.- Still ask clarifying questions if required for correctness.- Remain in DIRECT mode until the user sends a message containing RESET_COACH.```",SirYandi,2026-02-02 08:41:28,4,learnprogramming,t3_1qtnsgl,False,

That book is a product of its time: it focuses on C++ and Smalltalk which, at the time the book was written, were in a really bad place compared to today.The issue, in my opinion, is ""expressiveness."" Meaning, how easy is it to articulate a complex design in code?Expressive languages make it easy to accomplish complex tasks with code that is concise and easy to read and understand. The opposite is a language where those same tasks take far more code, and that code is difficult to read and understand.Most popular languages today are far more expressive than the popular languages of 30 years ago, even when they are technically the same language with 30 years of evolution between the two versions.When a language plus its standard library plus popular 3rd party libraries all combined push you toward a solution to your problem then yes, one could argue there is a design pattern there. But it was implemented in a library or framework, and you are simply along for the ride. Recognize the structure of the code, take a mental note, and move on. Go with the flow, not against it.I have over 25 years of experience in this field and I would struggle coming up with the ""most"" important thing to learn. I could certainly bucket sort various topics and say ""these are somewhere near the top"" and pattern recognition is certainly in that bucket.Other crucial skills to have:* Understanding data structures and algorithms. Even if you never implement a B-tree or linked list, understanding how they work will help you understand topics such as database indexing or queues.* Soft skills: working with project managers, QA, and customers. Knowing how to break down complex technical topics to people who do not have a computer science degree. Car analogies work well here.* A willingness to learn new things. Sometimes the easy, comfortable solution is ideal for your ego but not ideal for the project. Always be willing to expand your knowledge and learn new things as needed.

For instance, to understand how gates can make flip flops that can be used in shift registers, you really need to understand why ""shift registers"" are an important concept in binary mathematics, and to understand how a compiler converts high level language to assembly, you really need to understand both assembly AND abstract grammar and syntax - in other words, you need to understand both abstractions above and below the current thing you are trying to learn, as well as the abstract idea of the thing itself, all three of which requires knowledge of something else on all three levels!!Don't let that discourage you though - you should still be allowed to learn everything, but just don't fool yourself into thinking that there is a ""perfect"" order to learn them in, like go from the silicon to the CPU to machine code to assembly to compilers to higher level languages to abstract concepts - or indeed the other way around. Best suggestion is to start where you are, e.g. learn some Python, and work your way down, look at some assembly, then work your way up, towards more abstract programming concepts, data structures and whatnot, then back down again to another language, maybe C, and understand memory management, up again to understand garbage collecting and compilers, down again to understand addressing and registers in the CPU, and so on and on - not necessarily in this particular order, that was just a random example I made up on the spot.But take a look at ""**Code**"", and try to write programs in your chosen higher level language that handles binary conversion, and select topics based on your current interest.Also, if you are interested in the human history behind the computer, check out ""**The Innovators**: H*ow a Group of Inventors, Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution*"" by Walter Isaacson.",peterlinddk,2026-02-01 14:45:11,2,learnprogramming,t3_1qszres,False,

At all. If the first words from your lips aren't ""message passing"", then you don't know. If you've at least heard of it, but don't know how to implement it, you still don't know OOP.You're not wrong for not liking OOP, I just want you to understand it so that you know why you shouldn't like it.> But if you learn OOP as a course in college, you'd know that professors seem to think that it's God's perfect gift to programmers.I think at this point this is a holdover of when OOP was the dominant paradigm across the industry. We're still dealing with the mess the 90s had made.Most academic material is going to teach Python, Java, or C++, and they're either going to teach procedural Python, extremely bad Java focused on syntax, or C with Classes fucking imperative bullshit.> My biggest problem is that colleges overemphasize inheritance as a feature. This is so loaded it's not even wrong. There is an overemphasis inheritance, mostly from a C with Classes legacy.> Inheritance can be useful, but when used improperly, it becomes ridiculously difficult and annoying to work with.Like trying to eat soup with a claw hammer, the wrong tool for the job makes the job difficult. Your intuition - that pain your feeling, should be screaming that you're doing the wrong thing, and you need to seek out a different solution you don't yet know.> In software engineering, there is a concept called ""orthogonality"" [...] Inheritance completely shits on that.It doesn't. Software has many assholes, and can shit out of any one of them, any combination of them, or all of them at once.> OOP can have some very subtle and easy to overlook rules in how inheritance and polymorphism workYou've conflated a paradigm with your language of choice. OOP says nothing about how either of these principles work. C++ alone has over a dozen different types of inheritance, at least a dozen different types of polymorphism, and several different object representations. THAT is what you have to look out for.> so it's very easy to create subtle bugs that are hard to reason about. With language specifics in context, yes.> So yeah. By all means, learn OOP, but please do it well. Don't learn it the way professors have you learn itThe problem I've seen across academia is that the professors don't know what they're teaching, or they're not actually allowed to teach the paradigm - if they do know it. Typically they only teach the princples - abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. But even the Functional Programming paradigm has and exercises all these principles. This suggests a paradigm is greater than the sum of its parts.> focus on composing classes rather than inheritance. class C { int i; float f; char c; };Behold! HAS-A composition through tagged membership. Classes defined in such a way are tagged tuples. class C: std::tuple {};Behold!

Most real programs are more like a circle than a straight path, and the only reason that thats even true is that we write them to work that way so that we have some chance at reasoning about them.The good news, though, is that you don’t need to keep it all in your head at the same time. Programming is a never ending exercise in abstraction. To do the work, you only need to worry about the one piece that you’re working on at any moment. If you’re writing a function that computes a value based on its parameters, you don’t care where those parameters came from. If you’re calling another function, you don’t need to worry about how it does what it does — you only care about *what* it does (and sometimes how long it takes). Considering (and especially depending on) things outside the function can even be a liability.I’m glad that you’re sticking with it!

There used to be many different services that a site might want to offer besides HTTP. Like an FTP server with files at ftp.whatever.com, a gopher server at gopher.whatever.com, a mail server at mail.whatever.com, a USENET server at news.whatever.com or nntp.whatever.com. If you were coming from inside whatever.com's network you might hit smtp.whatever.com to send mail and imap.whatever.com to retrieve yours. Back in the day these would likely have actually been different physical computers. And in that world, www.whatever.com was just another service - ""www"" for ""World-Wide Web"".But it did not take long for the Web to take over the Internet, after which pretty much everything else took a back seat to it. The web was everyone's ""front door"", so they wanted to make it as easy as possible to get to. For that reason, most companies arranged for their top-level domain (""TLD""), when looked up all by itself, to point to their web server's IP address. That way you could just type `whatever.com` into your browser to get there. (Later browsers would add this as a fallback behavior; if you enter 'whatever.com' and it can't find an IP address for that, it will give 'www.whatever.com' a try. But originally it was up to the site owners to make that work.)Rather than just duplicating the web server's IP address record, which could lead to forgetting to change both in the future, the equivalence is usually accomplished by making the ""www"" subdomain an _alias_ for the TLD. (Not the other way around, because the root of a domain can't be an alias for technical reasons.) In the DNS database, the value associated with an alias record is the ""canonical name"" that it is an alias _for_, called a CNAME for short; for that reason, they're also called CNAME records, and sometimes aliases are called CNAMEs, even though that's sort of the opposite of what it means. Anyway, your example is one of those: $ dig +noall +answer www.9gag.com a www.9gag.com. 300 IN CNAME 9gag.com.What that means is that when a computer goes to look up the IP address of ""www.9gag.com"", it gets an answer back saying ""use the address of 9gag.com"". So it has to turn around and look up ""9gag.com"" to get the actual IP address. (Fortunately for the sake of net traffic reduction, when your computer looks it up, your ISP's nameserver has likely already done that for you and just returns both the CNAME and the IP addresses - A records for IPv4, AAAA records for IPv6 - in response to the original query.)",zeekar,2026-02-03 19:46:37,3,learnprogramming,t3_1qus7ht,False,

They *give* the code and only expect the learner to type it in - which is the totally wrong approach to learning. This is not learning.Worst tutorials are *""How to build X in language Y""* tutorials. They are plain useless. You, as the learner will not learn anything from them, not even the skill to build X in language Y on your own. All you will learn is to copy the code.About *proper usage* of tutorials: if you really go through a tutorial (not as a complete and utter beginner - as such, you should take a *course*), try to predict the code. Once the task following is explained, stop the tutorial and try to write the code on your own. Try a good amount of time and make different attempts if your first fails. Then, once you have a solution, or can't think of any other way, continue with the tutorial and compare - this way you train *your thinking* (which is far more important than your *coding*) and the coding plus, you get the final code to maybe learn the one or other thing from.I still think that the best approach to learning is first a solid *course* and then (and along with the course) program, program, program, program.

That said, if you did do changes to your code without these before, you can improve code quality without. I am saying this, because it can seem that you are not allowed to improve code quality before you learn about two or more different things. (But since unittest is build into the standard library, maybe give it a try and write some simple tests for the functions you change!)\- ""but I’m worried that even then it will still feel messy"". Yes, it will still feel messy, but thats just the first step, that enables the next ones. Its a journey and while the goal ""tidy code"" can be helpful as motivation it can also be overwhelming. \- Talking about ""proceeding in steps"": A simple technique that can help is identifying sections in code, lines that belong together. Give these sections a comment saying what the section does. Then try to pull out that section into a function. The function name now can take the task that the comment had: It tells what happens, without the need to reading the whole function. Try to make the function only rely on the parameters you pass to it instead of ""global state"" (also called a ""pure function""). This makes the function easy to test and to understand. This might not always be easy, but at least check if its possible. \- There are a lot of helpful texts there – [https://refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru) is a good online resource, Fowlers book ""Refactoring"" is also pretty helpful. Initially read them as inspiration, like browsing a cookbook, don't force yourself to use the methods immediately.

o27trby,"One of the things I like to do is not to factor into ""substeps"", but more like ""next steps"". Taking a big function and then making functions out of it often means that you're just switching between different functions, but have the same complexity. That's often actually worse.Breaking things down into ""input, process, output"" helps dramatically, especially if you can then extract the ""output"" to a separate method/object. If your big function makes a call to an API, does something with it, makes a call to another API, etc? Try to separate at those boundaries, or push things to the end. A useful pattern can be to gather up all of the changes you want in your function, and then apply them at the end.One strategy I've often used is to ""chop the tail"". What that means is finding the very last thing the function does, and then creating a new function at that point, taking all of the data it needs as parameters. You can then work through the function as a whole. This differs from the ""substep"" method because you can, when you make that final call, basically forget about what happened before that. If you call that last function with the right parameters, then the previous function was correct.

They know you won’t know every answer so just engage and tell them your thought process while approaching problems Make sure you test your Python install and have the tools etc working so you can run the code you writeYou’ll probably get a task to do. Don’t be afraid to look things up online if allowed. I’d expect you to use the Python docs You’ll be sharing your screen so make sure you don’t have anything inappropriate open / nsfw desktop wallpaper etcIf you’re given a coding task mock out what you plan to do in pseudo code first. Throw some empty functions in etc. just do what you need to outline the problem and what you’re going to build so it’s clear to youIf they give you a task which has multiple parts get one working then the next. Don’t try do everything all at once. I’d rather see a candidate get 2/3 problems solved and miss one than have 80% of all 3 and nothing working. Say to yourself make it work then make it better. And say to them that’s what you’re doing. If you have a short amount of time prioritise what you have to do and talk about the stuff you would do. Like you won’t have time to write perfect error handling or unit tests but say where you would add them and why. The biggest thing to remember. Interviewers usually aren’t assholes.

o2ja8lp,"Some advices:\- Don't get stuck on the ""learning new languages"" cycle, SPECIALLY on high-level programming languages. It's fine if you do this for a while, but the diminishing returns become heavy after. This is because newcomers don't yet have the necessary exposure and knowledge to do ""new things"", therefore they just fall in the trap of: learn new language -> learn basic syntax -> pretty much do nothing actually minimally important (to your learning) with this language -> get bored because you pretty much did nothing -> learn new language.\- Try to diversify your initial learning over several areas of computing: graphics, distributed systems, embedded systems, operating systems, application development (web & mobile), and so on... Quick extra tip: place your effort into learning operating systems more, everything nowadays use an operating system as a basis, and therefore having at least a minimal understanding of how they work is important.\- Try spending the majority of your time in an actual low-level programming such as C. I wouldn't recommend C++ just yet, because it won't give the same effect to a beginner as C does, this is because since C++ abstracts some stuff, beginners are prone of thinking about some features as an ""API"", which is not really what is happening, and this creates the exact opposite effect of what we want, since APIs in programming are usually perceived as a black box, and you don't want a black box, you want to actually understand what is going on. Just an additional note: I'd recommend coupling low-level programming learning with your OS studies.\---------I'd take my advices with a grain of salt however, because it really depends on what stage you already are, and what type of approach you have towards your learning process. I also think it's pretty important you start recognizing early on what is holding you back, and what isn't, because believe me, it's very easy to stagnate when learning programming, and it's very hard to get out of that hole as well.",mnelemos,2026-01-30 03:08:41,6,learnprogramming,t3_1qqr5hk,False,

Self-teaching + building a mental model _does_ indeed require non-trivial mental effort.One tip: When I need to read through particularly gnarly code, I like to keep notes in a separate text file or doc.I typically structure this in a 'question -> answer' kind of way, where I create a separate section for each open question or ""line of investigation"" I have. Maybe I'll also create a separate section for quick links, TODOs, snippets of cli commands to run, etc.I find having this sort of structure makes it much easier for me to stay focused, especially in cases where I feel too overwhelmed trying to mentally remember and keep track of everything.> I wonder if that is something that gets better after some time.It will -- as you get more familiar with the code, you'll have to spend less and less time digging, simply by virtue of you already being familiar with more aspects of the codebase.Even longer term, it'll get easier once you've worked on enough systems to start seeing similarities and echos. For example, if you've spend a fair amount of time working with backend and cloud infra, new codebases in the same domain will start feeling vaguely similar. There are only so many ways of reasonably structuring code after all.I'll take time for both types of familiarity/experience to grow though: it's totally expected/normal to feel a bit lost as an intern or new hire.> This is my first in person internship, so I don't know if it is normal to just stand up and walk for 5 minutes. That is what I used to do in remote internships.This is also normal. I've been programming professionally nearly a decade or so, and I also take short breaks once every hour or two. A quick stretch break, refilling my water, etc.If I'm feeling particularly stumped/annoyed, I'll often go on a longer 15-20m walk break, maybe step outside to grab some fresh air...Every now and then, I figure out how to ""enter the zone"" and manage to stay focused for hours and hours, though this usually happens when I'm writing code as opposed to debugging + investigating.

o3dsomh,"The nature of Undefined Behavior is that the compiler - most of the time, can't prove an error; therefore, the spec says it's up to you personally to make sure the code is correct. The BEST we can do is SOMETIMES detect SOME cases of UB and emit a warning.There's an insidious nature to UB - no one can define it. Signed integer overflow is often well defined on hardware, that doesn't mean the C++ spec or the compiler gets to defer to the hardware. It's still undefined behavior. In fact, UB allows a compiler to optimize very aggressively. If, for example, you overflowed, you cannot reliably detect you've overflowed. You might think hey - just see if an increment of a positive results in a negative. But the compiler KNOWS overflow ""cannot"" happen, so it can correctly optimize the ""obviously"" impossible check out, and code paths that presume overflow didn't happen get a negative value anyway.Thus is the nature of UB. You're not going to win against the compiler's CORRECT assumptions that you're NOT going to fuck around with UB. And you don't know how the compiler is going to act upon those assumptions at any given time. Believe it or not, compilation itself is not inherently deterministic.Further, you may not even get consistent behaviors between program runs, or even while the program is running. And once UB has been evaluated at runtime, you cannot rely on what the program is going to do afterward.UB is to be respected. Your x64 or Apple M may be robust, but UB is what bricks a Nintendo DS, most famously when glitch hacking Pokemon or Zelda; you end up accessing an invalid bit pattern that fries some circuits in the ARM5 core.A lot of engineers are incorrectly dismissive of UB. These engineers would NEVER get a job working on critical systems, where that attitude is going to get a people killed, cause billions in damages, or cause unrecoverable losses.I hear the attitude - ""We're not saving lives, here..."" Yeah? You wanna diminish your company and it's product more? Do that in front of the CEO. You might not be saving lives with every product, but to be dismissive is also putting the revenue streams and the reputation of the company at risk. No one wants to hear it.

I guess there is a good chance that the pointer still shows to some data where ""10"" is stored. But that is not necessarily so.

If you're working on a project with other people, it probably makes sense to talk to those people and agree on how to format your commit messages. For example, [""Conventional Commits""](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is one example of a consistent way to format your commit messages. But for a solo project, it really doesn't matter at all whether you stick rigidly to something like this.As far as the *types* of information you should be putting in your commit messages: it should be enough to explain both what you changed and why you changed it, to a level of detail that you find sufficient. Commit messages are a form of documentation, and there's no one ""right"" level of detail for your documentation. It depends on how much time you're willing to spend on it.If you want some inspiration, you can take a look at the Linux, which generally has very detailed commit messages. Often the messages are much longer than the corresponding code changes. A Linux kernel PR won't be accepted if the maintainers don't think the commit message is clear enough, even if the code itself is fine.For instance, [this recent commit](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/76ed27608f7dd235b727ebbb12163438c2fbb617) has 31 lines of text (plus footers) to describe a 13-line code change. The first line contains just the most crucial details: the change affects performance monitoring (""perf"") in the scheduler (""sched"") subsystem, and it fixes a potential crash. The rest of the message goes into detail about exactly why the problem is happening and how it was fixed.Again, you probably don't need to go into nearly that level of detail for *all* your commits, especially if you're working on a project that's less critical than the Linux kernel. But while you're writing code, you should be thinking about how you would explain what you're doing to another programmer. And then you can decide how much of that explanation you want to put into the commit message.----Note also that deciding how to *describe* your commits goes hand-in-hand with deciding *what* changes to include in each commit. In the example I gave, it's straightforward to describe the commit's purpose because it's a very small, self-contained change.

What data structures (at least: Arrays, Lists, Dictionaries, Stacks and Queues) are.After that, then you can go to the game engine.If you mean the whole ""getting used to your environment"" - start by following a short game tutorial, and then adding functionality to it (make flappybird, then add a coin collecting mechanic - or extra life pickups). This will teach you where things are, and how to get there. When following the tutorial, don't follow line by line, but section by section. Watch for a few minutes, and then repeat it on your own trying not to reference the video.

Think about what you want to accomplish, and quantify it. If it ain't quantifiable, explain it as a story that gives quantifiable metrics. We call these Functional & Non-functional/Quality Requirements. Define and prioritize those first. Once you know exactly what it is you want to make, start to break that thing down into identifiable entities, their components, and their relationships to everything else. Think about how the game works, and the major parts of it.* Look up SOLID programming principles, and Object Oriented Design Patterns. They are incredibly helpful in game dev, because they teach you how to arrange ideas in a way that's typically useful for simulations like games* When in doubt about how certain things work, read the docs. They are dense, but they're by far the most useful resource at your disposal.* Follow a consistent coding style. Your code should look the same regardless of where it is - this makes it easier to parse over later.

o3chysa,"I don’t know about Dart, but in many languages it’s possible (or sometimes required) to override an object’s hash code function, so (contrary to some comments here) it’s important to understand how they work.No, hash collisions are possible. They’re even quite likely if a developer has written a bad hashing function on their object. Assuming everything else in the system is written correctly, these bad hashing functions will impact efficiency but not correctness.Comparing two objects for pointer equality is generally very cheap, and this is what `==` does in most languages. “Pointer equality” means that the objects are in identical memory locations (whether on the machine or on a VM; the details are complicated but not relevant right now.) This means the objects are really and truly “the same”; if you mutate one, the other will be mutated as well, because they’re the same object.Comparing two object’s hash codes is frequently cheap, but not as cheap as pointer equality, because hash codes are often highly optimized and frequently cacheable. If the compiler/runtime knows that the object hasn’t changed since the last time you’ve computed its hash, it can choose to reuse the result of the last hashing operation instead of running it again.Comparing two objects for value equality can be expensive. “Value equality” means that the objects are conceptually the same. For nested objects, this generally means walking the whole object graph and comparing each piece of data in both objects to each other. For small objects this is cheap, for big objects it might not be. Value equality is a conceptually stronger guarantee than pointer equality, because it tells you that two objects “mean” the same thing, even if they were constructed at different locations. However, this can be fragile in the presence of mutability, because if you mutate one of the objects they might stop being equal.If you want to check whether two objects have value equality, usually you do this:1. Check whether the objects have pointer equality. If they do, the objects are equal and you’re done. Pointer equality implies value equality. 2. Check whether the objects have hash code equality. If they don’t, then they are unequal, and you’re done. Hash code inequality implies value inequality. 3. As a last resort, check whether the objects have value equality. Hash codes are especially necessary as a performance optimization when using objects in collections which have limitations around item equality. `Set` and `Map`/`Dictionary` are the main ones which come to mind. In a set you don’t want there to be multiple copies of objects which are equal to each other, and in a dictionary you don’t want to add duplicate keys. In both of these situations you’re not just comparing two objects for equality, you’re comparing one object to a whole bunch of objects and seeing if it’s equal to any of them. In a big collection, this would get more expensive as the collection gets bigger. Without hash codes, adding N items to a set is an O(N^2) operation. So the way these data structures are usually implemented is by using “buckets” of items which have hash codes in a given range. When you want to add an object, the data structure computes its hash code, then finds the bucket which it belongs to (an `O(M)` operation, where `M` is the number of buckets, or in some cases `O(1)`, depending on the implementation). Then, if there’s already items in the bucket, the object being added is compared to every item in that bucket until an equal object is found. (`O(N)`, for a much smaller `N` than before). All in all this is asymptotically much, much faster.Of course, as I alluded to earlier, mutability messes this whole thing up. If you mutate an object in a way that would change its hash code then the algorithm used by the data structure will no longer perform correctly and it will be left in an invalid state.Hopefully this helps.

The important thing is that when you set a variable = some other value, it doesn't matter where it originally got its value from, it is gone. And setting v2 = v1 doesn't ""link"" v2 and v1 in any way, it just makes them have the same value.Now for the tricky part!A value like 4 and 5 cannot be changed, setting v1 to 5 and then setting v2 to v1 and v2 to 4, does not change neither 4 nor 5, it only changes the variables v1 and v2.But a *value* like a list, **can be changed**, you can replace individual items, add or remove them - it is still the same list. You cannot replace or remove anything in the number 5.So this code does change the inside of l1: list l1 = ['c','a','t']; // we declare a list 'l1' with 'c','a' and 't' myOtherListFunc( l1 ); // then we send that list as an argument to the new function def myOtherListFun( l2 ) { // and receive the same list as variable 'l2' l2.add('s'); // and we modify the inside of the list! // this has also changed the list for 'l1' because it is the same list }There's nothing magic about it - note that we don't write `l2 = ['c','a','t','s']` because that would change l2 to be another list, just like v2 was changed to be another number.If we could write `v2.increment()` or something like that, we would be able to change v1 through v2, but as that is usually not the case in most languages, programmers like to say that numbers are copied and lists are referenced - although it rarely is like that.",peterlinddk,2026-02-03 10:04:58,1,learnprogramming,t3_1quc0t2,False,

So it's not that suitable for allocating new memory for data in the future. So the OS have a mechanism (heap) for requesting new memory pages in order for a program to be able to create new objects while it's running. If not for pointers we wouldn't be able to refer to objects located in heap because we don't know beforehand where they would be located, the compiler knows only about variables on the .data section.

Some are more efficient than others, some are better readable/maintainable than others, and some are good middle-grounds between efficiency and readability/maintainability - that's the ones a programmer should strive for. If your solution is super intelligent and efficient but you are the only one who understands it, it is useless in production, but may be nice for competitions, if your solution is super slow but extremely readable, you're on the other end of the scale and should work on your speed.It's all a matter of experience.

I quite enjoy employing common algorithms in interesting ways \[re: not LLM/AI stuff as that wasn't around!\]; I get to pursue a much wider variety of workflows/techniques since I can draw on a wider skillset.Learning how to paint, the mixtures, pigments, etc \[I got quite into paint this last year\] has really taught me the details of finishing, coating, and protecting anything I may make - from furniture to housing. And a quick coat of paint can make a used, cheap piece look brand new!Plus I find learning both digital and traditional art reinforces the core skills one needs to make good art overall. Composition, colors, lighting, texture, detail density, etc - all necessary to practice regardless of the medium.What's the point of being a programmer if you don't also get a bit of time to pursue other topics that you enjoy? I think it's worthwhile to read history, but I can tell you it will not be getting me raises anytime soon!Lastly, when you learn things, it may open doors you previously would not have been aware of. The twists of life might open a door or two that would've been hidden otherwise.Finally, the AI stuff concerning \*making\* art is such a strong debate I think all the noise around it always misses the forest for the big tree. Thinking on it, however, one faces the same core issues with generative tools as you did with old school algorithmic/digital art!Say my 200x200 random pixel generator is able to theoretically produce any piece of art ever. (any piece in a 200x200 space of course) The problem is, statistically, most art produced is random noise. It's all \*seems\* the same - despite both pieces of noise being very different in terms of data - because both noises communicate the same exact thing to the audience. ""This is random noise"".IMO, to make impactful art, you've\- You've got to understand why and which elements evoke what you want in the audience. \- You've got to understand what is important, what isn't, and tightly control what is important. \- And generate interesting ideas within the work of any sort.The first two require lots of practice and is a soft skill - much like cooking w/o a recipe. The last one, I find, is much easier when I pore over an artwork and let the creative process compound on itself. (And study lots of extraneous subjects or other artworks to pull more ideas from!)Much like you've got to learn how to draw your basics before you can start breaking the rules, I think the biggest problem AI presents is it can undercut the learning process, development of personal styles, & creative process. Much like if you only ever followed ""paint by numbers"" kits and never challenged yourself further.\[Though once you've got your art down, and you find it has a useful part in your workflow, I figure it becomes a tool like any other -- IP issues not withstanding. Albeit I'm cantankerous and refuse to give up any control to blackboxes : P. And can't really see how'd I use it in a way that isn't covered by photobashing & art archives ha!

You start with microcontroller firmware and USB.⸻Step 1: Pick a microcontroller and read its datasheet like scriptureMost custom keyboards use:•ATmega32U4 (classic Arduino Pro Micro)•RP2040•STM32The key requirement: native USB device support.Before writing any keyboard code, you must understand:•GPIO configuration•Timers / interrupts•USB endpoints•Flash + RAM limitsThis is not optional. QMK hides this pain; you’re choosing to feel it.⸻Step 2: Implement a matrix scanner (this is the soul)A keyboard PCB is usually a row × column matrix.Algorithmically:•Set all columns as outputs•Set all rows as inputs with pull-ups•Drive one column LOW at a time•Read rows•Repeat fast (≈1 kHz)You will write:•GPIO init•A scan loop•A key state bitmapThis alone teaches you more embedded thinking than most app devs ever touch.⸻Step 3: Debouncing (time becomes real)Switches lie. They bounce.You need:•Per-key state•Timestamp or counter•Stable-state confirmationClassic strategies:•Integrator counters•Time-based debounce•State machinesQMK has multiple debounce algorithms. Rewriting one is a rite of passage.⸻Step 4: Build a key event pipelineAt this point you have:•Raw matrix state•Press / release eventsNow you design your own internal API:raw_scan → debounced_state → key_event → actionThis is where you can do things QMK doesn’t:•Probabilistic chording•Pressure-aware timing•Contextual layers (editor-aware, app-aware)This is where creativity lives.⸻Step 5: USB HID from scratch (the dragon)Now the hard truth:USB is the real boss fight.You must implement:•USB descriptors•HID report descriptors•Polling interval logic•Key rollover handlingYou can:•Write USB by hand (brutal but pure)•Or use a thin USB stack (LUFA, TinyUSB) without keyboard logicThis is still “from scratch” in spirit—USB is a protocol, not magic.⸻Step 6: Layers, macros, and remapping (language emerges)Layers are just:•Lookup tables•Stackable keymaps•State-dependent resolutionMacros are:•Event playback engines•Timed HID reportsNothing mystical. QMK only organizes it well.⸻Where to actually learn this (non-obvious sources)Not “keyboard tutorials.” Those are downstream.Study instead:•USB HID specification•LUFA examples (keyboard + mouse)•Bare-metal MCU tutorials•Old AVR keyboard firmware (pre-QMK era)Then read QMK last, like reading a cathedral after learning how stones are cut.⸻A sharper insight most people missQMK is not a keyboard firmware.QMK is:•A hardware abstraction layer•A policy engine for input•A build system that normalizes chaosIf you rebuild it, don’t clone it.Design something smaller, stranger, and opinionated.For example:•A keyboard that adapts layout based on typing entropy•A keyboard that changes layers by time-of-day•A keyboard optimized for African language input patterns•A keyboard that treats macros as code, not sequencesThat’s how you go beyond “my own QMK” and into new instruments.",AltruisticSteak3952,2026-01-29 10:27:54,3,learnprogramming,t3_1qq414s,False,

My guess is that (3) is really inefficient because you're constantly jumping around in your file in random order, which is the most inefficient thing for a file.Instead what you want is to have all of your file reads/writes to be sequential, and do the random swapping only in memory.There are two algorithms to consider:I think most likely an ""External Distribution Sort"" would be the most efficient:1. Decide on how much you can have in memory at a time (like 100 MB, or 1 GB)2. Partition the data into chunks of approximately that size. As an example if your keys started with the letters A - Z, and you had 13 chunks, you could put A & B in chunk 1, C & D into chunk 2, and so on.3. Now sort each partition by loading it into RAM.4. Finally join the files together into one large file.As an alternative, an External Merge Sort would also work. Split into chunks without partitioning, sort each chunk in RAM, then merge all of the chunks together in one pass.Both External Distribution Sort and External Merge Sort have the property that the disk reads and writes are sequential. You might have multiple files open at a time, but you're never skipping around in the same file.Switching to either one of those could give as much as a 100x speedup, because that's the difference between how fast sequential access vs random access is when reading large files from disk.",dmazzoni,2026-02-03 02:38:20,1,learnprogramming,t1_o39fk6x,False,

As I said, early in my career I was prefering frontend and invested a lot of time in javascript and related frameworks, was interested in UX design even (real full stack back then :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: from db schema design, backend to the html and css). Years later I was focused more on backend. Then the natural things in career growth - managing teams, where soft skills are way more important. But turned out that was not really my thing, being too far from creating things and instead, doing hiring, budgeting, such kind of boring stuff. Now I am in architect role - mostly talking and drawing, but way more connected to development teams, although not writing code. Don't miss it. Only occasionally I get to code something by myself helping teams in hard situations and I like it so. My point is - you shouldn't overthink it that much. There is no right or wrong, every decision comes with mistakes and lessons. Whatever you choose, you will learn something. If you do a mistake, you will learn more! And with years you will eventually get bored in something. One more important advice - stay there, where there are better guys than you - to compete with them and learn fron them. If you notice you aren't learning and progressing - change the job and even consider shift in technology or role. It's not that big of a problem to shift from c# to java .. or python.

Depending on your stack, there are several tools out there to use. Even if you dont have access to any tools, you can double check no vulnerabilities are associated with any dependency versions on your project.3. Upgrade project dependencies. This one can be tricky and requires a lot of regression testing.4. Update, create, and improve junit test cases and test case coverage. Create/improve mock services5. Improve CI/CD. Add quality of life features6. \^Build internal tools to help with automation and testing such as a data generator.7. Improve dashboard and alerting capabilities. Check if there are any metrics you can track that will help alert you of any issues with your project. If none exists, create a metrics dashboard or try to get your team/company to adopt one from the various providers. You could even keep it simple and create a cron job on a linux server that executes a script daily to pull metrics from your logs and database to alert you of any issues. Though there better solutions.8. Study anything related to your job. Learn what you need to in order to eventually help your teammates with their load. Learn more about intricacies of the languages used in your stack. Research tools and libraries that may help your project. Sometimes you can be the one to introduce new technology to the stack that improves something you already have or completely replaces it for some benefit or another.9. Update project documentation. You could also create guides for any new people that may join the team in the future10. Innovate. Maybe you can figure out a good way to leverage AI in your project. Don't immediately jump to an LLM.

You should be aiming for code quality that *exceeds* the quality of your prior manual output, and you should always understand the details of how it all works - neither of which are very hard if you leverage the AI to do this (e.g. get it to refactor when needed, use other AI tools to review the code, ask for explanations).Most ""vibe coders"" don't do this, and that's where tech debt problems come in quickly.

Just a month ago I landed my first SWE job. There are definitely go guarantees, and it will likely take a while but its definitely not impossible. My advice would be to focus on 1. Projects: Building projects that you can talk about and show in some way, whether it be a demo of the project, a blog, or anything else. With AI you can pretty much just pick any topic you are interested in, find something that seems interesting to build and is within a reasonable scope and build it. Bonus points if its a product that solve actual peoples problems, product thinking is highly valued at startups. The goal is to show people that you have actually done stuff, and to be able to talk about it.2. Network: The most universal thing I learned after a year of searching for jobs was that pretty much everyone I knew got their job through some sort of connection and is also how I ended up getting my job, and this is doubly true in todays market. Network as aggressively as you can (not annoyingly but just a lot of people) and reach out to your own personal network. The cost is basically nothing other than maybe your ego, and the upside is tremendous, you never know who could be the one that has the connect, and people are very often happy to help. Definitely still apply to companies but don't spend too much time on it especially if you aren't getting much positive feedback. Your first job will most likely be from just knowing the right person (networking) and actually having something to show for your skills (projects).

Software development isn't a zero sum game, for US developers to win, EU doesn't have to lose, and vice versa.Do we chalk this up to people just being young? Do European posters in /r/cscareerquestions ALSO skew young and NOT actually employed as software developers, just like the US counterparts?Anyways, unlike many people here, I regularly during the course of my work, engage with large teams of European engineers. Primarily engineers from Ireland, Poland, and Germany. Ireland is unique, in that it also has a large diaspora of engineers from OTHER European countries. These have included multiple engineers from England, Spain, and France, and Architects from Ireland, Italy, and England.Two things that have helped dramatically, are: Persistent and clear communication. Both parties need to be patient, and be ""clear"" with their communication. English will be the lingua fraca, but all English is not the same. Focus on using COMMON, more likely to be known, phrases, words, etc. Avoid idioms that someone not from your country isn't going to know. It's REALLY common for native speakers/writers to go crazy with this and communicate in a way that is very difficult to understand. Simplify it down. Assume positive intent, if something SOUNDS off, it's probably a bad translation. Every language has it's own difficulties in translation to English. Above all else, patience by BOTH parties.The other, is absolutely when working with counterparts in other cultures, you HAVE to learn and understand what their leadership and accountability paradigm is, relative to yours. Do NOT assume it is the same way, at all, to yours. How people are led (do people DEFER to leadership, or INFORM leadership), how people are mentored, how people are held accountable, differs WILDLY between cultures; and, even within that culture, particularly in Poland I see big differences between junior and senior engineers. I suspect in that country there's a divide there too; if I had to guess, it's roughly the 15+ and above vs. the newer peeps. But, I don't fully understand, despite how much polish interaction I get.With that last one, comes ASSUME positive intent. Assume they WANT to get the job done, and done well, and seek to understand how and why they're behaving the way they are. A metaphor I like to use borrows from the old American story about the cherry tree and the axe. If ""Culture A"" was going to cut down a tree, and had 10 hours to do it, how many hours would they spend sharpening the axe?"" The polish would sharpen the axe, and a backup axe, for 9.5 hours. The Irish? They cut it down last week. My point? The spread between preparing for the act, and doing the act, varies wildly, and can be a VERY common source of frustration ALL around.Anyways, good luck.

o2ctpdb,"In my opinion,Living where you want, getting a job in tech, and having no experience are not feasible together. I'd recommend hunting for experience. I'd recommend looking for contract work for projects in resource extraction areas. Think big mines that have 2000 computers that need to be maintained and also upgraded every few years.Having your degree (?) means you will have no issue with the software side and you will be able to learn the hardware side better. Once you have a few years experience there, look for jobs back home with contracting companies or actual companies themselves that support point of sale devices for merchants, do a few years of that.Then you have software, hardware, and point of sale support and you can do some social networking with local tech support companies and you might have better luck back home.The problem that I encountered when I was trying to break in, is I was competing with all these 40 year old people with 15 years experience that were moving back, and I just couldn't stand up against them.Now as it turns out where I am it is super rural, good help is hard to find, I found a great job, 20 min from my door to my desk, and it is a nice town; so I stayed, but I prefer a more rural setting.

Seek out contracting firms and recruiters, there's one on Michigan named Blue Chip. I'm sure your state has something like it.Finally, contact any careers department at your college.

And as markets condense, squeezing out many, you’re unfortunately left with few roles, with cheaper pay, and likely more cause for nepotistic hiring.The difference is unemployment rates are sky high for CS atm, less jobs, and more applicants from senior positions from layoffs at big named places.

No, you move before it affects your life personally.

Founders were all either cofounders of multi-billion/reputable companies or academics with strong track records, established backgrounds, and connections. They also had a strong presence and vision and were not afraid to push their board and investors around (a little). 2. Seed and series A Funding well exceeded anything I’ve previously seen by a wide margin. In part because of #13. Super talented and high velocity founding team. This was super important because we pivoted a lot early on while finding market fit and we could do so quickly (hours-days). Within first few months we had over X million DAU. 4. Funny enough we were B2C. In some ways this was an advantage as success/failure signals were very visible early on and we had a lot of word of mouth engagement.5. We had a lot of attention in the media and somehow obtained partnerships with the biggest players in tech (NVIDIA, OpenAI, Microsoft) who gave us resources, insider access, and a platform in their marketing and events. I have no idea how this came together but it seemed very organic tbh6. Side effect of everything else but people were applying from FAANG and other unicorns to join our team.

Most software devs have to be at least a little ""jack of all trades"" and doing whatever it takes to get things done is normal and a valuable skill to hone.> I failed every single deadline.Honestly, for an intern working solo, that's kinda par for the course. I don't think that says that much about you. And for that matter, often times, issues with deadlines is not an individual dev problem, but a management problem.> And more than once, I had to (not by my choice, but it did sort of help once) go on weekends to catch up.I know the pressure can be hard to avoid, don't work weekends. It's common that deadlines slip and stuff takes longer than expected. It shouldn't generally be a ""work extra"" thing, particularly not for no extra pay. From a practical standpoint, I understand it if your job is on the line (the economy and all), but resist the pressure under normal circumstances.Overall, sadly, intern positions on solo projects aren't that uncommon, yet are obviously bad for the intern. Mind you, you also don't fit the typical case of an intern, as you are actually a new grad. I think the biggest thing to get used to is the idea that it's okay for work to not be finished. You're not actually being paid by task. And yes, solo projects are strictly worse for a new person (or arguably any person) in pretty much every way (hard to get help, isolating, more likely to have incorrect estimates, etc).

Maybe not about technical best practices (since those are best learnt while working with a team with seniors directing development and giving you feedback in PRs), but you end up coming out of this with a healthy fear of forced estimates, you learn how to communicate with people who disagree or are displeased with you, and you'll generally perform much better when the inevitable crisis hits at your next job.

You simply become another statistic that complains about the job market, because you put in 3,500 resumes and got 4 total responses, 3 of which declined you and one got you through. In my experience so far just doing it by hand I have yet to have a job completely ghost me and I am currently sitting at 12 applications. Mind you these were all declines still, and I will have to hunt for a little while. I do use Ai, specifically for cover letters though, but more of a guidance than fully copy pasting. Everything comes from me, but using Ai to get the thoughts flowing rather than sitting there and spending an hour on each letter that nobody will read just makes sense. I can get the creative juices flowing and type away the letter in about ten minutes or so. So, there is certainly a usefulness to Ai.I also certainly do not want to tell you which way is better over the other. It is literally a matter of do you want to manually apply to 50 - 200 places and have a higher chance of hearing something back? Or do you just want to apply to every job on the planet and not hear zip except for a couple gold mines? Believe me, there are a ton of people out there not using Ai at all or even experienced it, so they get a letter that sounds like a robot typed it (if they read it), it is going right in the trash.

The main problem is that for us, nerdy guys, the main employers are small to mid-sized companies ( startups mainly - ""The backbone of the economy"").Startups are hiring only when they are profitable now (rarely), mid/large companies prefer to hire offshore and pay a hotdog per hour (bellow 12 bucks) or push for AI. This is the harsh reality: unless you play a major role in the company's security/policy, you are out.That's why most jobs are now in Fintech or Healthtech, these are extremely sensitive and offshoring is too risky.

o2oodld,"In my opinion,You sound like me, 18 years ago. I kept chasing the dream and kept burning out and crashing. I wish I had been less stubborn and willing to listen to a mentor.I would recommend making the game development a hobby, make it for androids, and make it to fix specific table top game editions, like D&D.But I found that the more I worked at the fun, the less fun it was. Turns out I have a.d.h.d. and autism and if I had been able to be medicated through school, I would have been unstoppable.I was pretty bitter trying to find work in 2008-2011 in video games while learning and programming in C++ for ""the game"" I had in my head. Then once I would know what ""the game"" was, I would do some research and find out that someone else had the idea and had already done it.That's when it hit me, the ideas are a dime a dozen, and everyone has them; it's being able to make it into a reality and get it to market faster than the competition that gets the money.The secret, kookily enough, was watching the movie ""the secret"" and saying to myself ""If I am always saying that I am burned out and there are no jobs, then that is my reality"". So instead I said ""I am a positive person, pleasant to be around, I love people, and there are lots of jobs I would enjoy (each of those was a lie)"".I just had that mindset and I just flipped the job search rules on its head and I just applied for everything that looked interesting. I had one resume, one cover letter, a few letters of reference, and then I just ""cold job applied"", or ""shotgun approach"". I just stopped looking at the job, the description, the requirements, and instead of stressing about if I qualified for a job or tailoring my resume and cover letter for one hour and then applying for one job in two hours, I did a blanket google search, opened up the top ten results in tabs, and just went through uploading my resume and cover letter to sites and applying for as many jobs as I could. Some were an email, some were uploading documents, some were transcribing into their web fields, so some took a minute to apply to, some took 20 minutes. I just applied and applied and applied.I ""knew"" everyone else was going to be tailoring their resume to the job, so instead of me doing that for each one, I wrote the cover letter like it was a personal conversation between friends and I sold myself as an amazing worker and someone they wanted on their team.I'd been applying for about a day before I got a call for a job where they were looking for a permanent full time position (but I didn't know that cause I hadn't really read the job listing). I had a 2 year technical diploma and had just finished my 3rd year of a bsc in computer science, I was on summer break...So I went to the preliminary interview and fucking nailed it with my positive attitude and my honest answers of ""I don't know what that is or how to do it, but I honestly don't know what I am doing with most things. What I know how to do is know when I don't know, I know how to look something up, and I learn fast"".They ended up hiring me for a summer rather than any of the other full time applicants that they had. I fucking love automation and I get bored easily. It was a tech support job for a software development company, so everytime I answered a question, I templated the response. There's really only 20 questions anyone could have about this software, and I knew what they were cause I had been doing templated responses from May to July.In July I asked to get some screen recording and captioning software to make some tutorial videos; I made basic, intermediate, and advanced video tutorials, published them, and the calls stopped.I had automated myself out of a job, and then I went back to school and finished my fourth year.I had a competitive job offer from them half way through the year, full benefits, to come back and work for them. It was a great company, it got acquired during covid, but I did basically the same thing for them for 3 years before moving on.I just kept looking at something that had to be done more than once and figured out how to automate it.The moral of this story is sometimes you have to run before you can walk. Successfully selling yourself and taking initiative to do your job and improve everything, rather than just collecting a cheque allowed me to develop a specific set of skills.I work for a much bigger company now, ""work"" is a strong term. I do tech support and am on a team with other people where we get sent problems no one can figure out how to fix.

More typical is ML people dabbling w/ backend-ish things (often poorly) and other traditional roles (backend/frontend/etc) interfacing with each other through API contracts, which is just bog standard software engineering.LC is useful to the extent that you get to practice certain types of coding skills and patterns that CRUD/glue code development doesn't necessarily expose you to, but it isn't strictly necessary if you deal with things like graph traversal or memoization in their glorious raw forms (aka not relying too much on libs to do DS&A-ish things) on a semi-regular basis.

After that, you may find that you don’t actually need synchronous standups EVERY day, maybe MWF, with async versions on TTh unless specifically needed.",chamberlain2007,2026-01-29 03:30:27,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1qpwv0x,False,

o2gjcxg,"I did.You first note that you keep 14 hours of availability (if you take a call at 9 pm, you're talking until 9:30 pm or later).You bend over backwards so your org can underpay someone in a different time zone. You have, at best, 10 hours in a day that is truly yours. After sleeping, eating, and showering, that rounds up to 0 hours where you mind isn't actively available to your company or your basic human needs.And the worst part is you don't even acknowledge it. You point to tools to handle async comms but undercut it with your own experience of 14 hours that isn't yours.Your compliance allows for this model to thrive. I'm sure your company loves you...until they configure out how to move your role offshore, too.Edit: Do you have a wife? Kids? I hope the paycheck makes this sacrifice worthwhile. I mean that truly. You're obviously intelligent enough to make that choice -- I just fear you don't fully comprehend the choice you're making.FWIW, I'm in the same boat.
