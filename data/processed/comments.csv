nw805fa,"I choose for Data Engineering pretty early in my career and I'm very happy I did so.When you're a Data Scientist, one of your key goals is to extract meaning from data. You run models and try to get insights. It is very often the case though that the data either doesn't show what you would like, or it kind of does, but with pretty low certainty. Even more often the data is so bad that you couldn't really draw any conclusions from it.This puts you in a bind. You have to go explain your conclusions to the sales guys and they can't work with 'it sort of shows X, but also kind of Y'. They need to sell a product and they will. So they'll massage your conclusions in ways that you might even not agree with. Or you'll be pressured to massage the data, which I've been asked to do. I always covered my ass with emails although I luckily never needed them.As a Data Engineer on the other hand, there is no discussion. Either the data is in the required spot in the required form or it isn't. At the end of the day, your product is finished and whether or not someone can actually do anything with it downstream is not your concern. It's a very liberating feeling and it means I have barely any stress related to work.I'm not the only person I've encountered who feels similarly and I've even met a few Data Scientists who made a similar switch later in their career for similar reasons.Another saving grace is that Data Scientists are a dime in a dozen nowadays. With the AI boom everyone and their cat tried to get some certification somewhere and the quality varies wildly. Data engineering isn't as sexy and there's much fewer people in the field I have the impression.

nw84diz,"Do you like maths? DS. Are you curious, have a discovery mindset? DS. Do you like building stuff, to technical specifications? DE.For me the answer was simple. I naturally gravitated towards technical specifications and engineering solutions. I was interested in maths, but having done some statistics courses, it wasn’t a mountain I wanted to climb.Personally I wouldn’t over think it. People swap between DS and DE all the time. A large company will probably help you transition, pay for training etc because they know there is a great deal of synergy between these teams. ie. DE’s will productionise DS models so knowing both sides isn’t a waste of time.Where I currently work, DS is seen as a ‘luxury’. They will increase headcount when times are good, and conversely, DS’s are the first people out the door when times are bad. This is because they generally work on ‘optimisations’, I guess just like how you would pause remodelling your house if you lost your job and didn’t have income coming in. DE on the other hand is much more stable. They need people to keep existing pipelines running, even if new things aren’t being built. It was how I ended up in DE, I was made redundant as a DS but told I could stay on if I switched teams. I thought I’d do this while I searched for a new DS position, but I found my proclivities more suited to DE, so never left and never thought about switching back.Generally the people who make the best DE’s have done Computer Science or Engineering degrees that involve data transfers like Telecoms. The people who make the best DS’s have done Science or Mathematics degrees. Maybe start out in the field where your degree gives you the best foundations?

There aren't any libraries to end up unmaintained. If you *really* need to you can port to another database technology and most of your transformations will port over perfectly.

nwds2vq,"SCD2 is built into the table schema, the code base is based on Merge or UpSert + delete tracking.I suggest you look at ""Timestamp"" column type if available on your platform, or look into MD5() function which is quite universal, to do ""hashing"" of data, and use a staging layer.When you design properly a SCD2 table in a bronze layer, and have a staging layer in a ""raw"" layer (you should always have a staging layer!) - then a SQL view with the hashed values (the PK columns, the entire data row) then SCD2 becomes a breeze to do. Breeze because you compare two tables, you have one PK column and one HashDIFF column (or TimeStamp from a source DB) that tells you easily what to do.Often it is deletion tracking the most difficult - because if you get differential data, how do you know what no longer exists in source? In such cases you need an extra pipeline logic just for delete tracking. Mentioning as this is often overlooked and it comes back to bite you at the end.For example, you load new data (from a full source or differential source) truncate/load into a staging table. Make a view to create all the extra columns you need, like using MD5() in the view. Use the staging view to do the UpSerts or Merge based on your bronze layer SCD2 historical table and the staging. For delete tracking sometimes you need a new pipeline to get a full from source but only the PK column(s), not all the columns, so the file is smaller and the process is quicker. I use a different staging table, a different pipeline, just for this. Or if you are lucky, you can get CDC from source DB and then you have 100% of all changes. If only we had this all the time.So basically you read the same data twice, the first time the data are usually files in a datalake or a file share, but it could also be a remote database that you ODBC / OleDB into to run a query. This is usually for on-prem, but I have used ODBC + MySQL remote DBs to gather info, it works really well, and no ELT/ETL tool required - it's all SQL in a stored proc.Some people create in the staging table all the extra fields to manage for SCD2 and the tool they use to consume the raw data into staging, adds the values to the extra fields, row-by-row. I do NOT like this method, as it puts intelligence inside the ELT/ETL tool making it difficult to manage. An ELT/ETL tool should be simple, just do mapping, Lift & Shift, ideally never fail - just get the data to staging table(s) and let the next level deal with issues. CSV is hell on earth, I use the BLOB technique on foreign CSV files and parse with SQL.FWIW, this topic (SCD2, 3, 4, hybrid...) is taught in actual classes world wide, maybe look into taking some basic ETL/ELT & BI courses, at least Udemy. My first SCD2 table I did back in 1998 - just to give you an idea on how old this logic is, the actual invention I don't know who - but probably Kimball in the 90's.

Same works for if any service decides to call my endpoints, I can stop any processing to happen if request data to my endpoint is wrong.Dataclasses - used mainly for internal data transfer. An example for this is, let's say after my Pydantic validation occurs I now want to move around the fields I can set them in a dataclasses and move them around with pass by value/ reference. Now I can do this with Pydantic also but why I shouldn't. Pydantic does have an overhead when it parses the field this is very small but I've hit cases when it matters (Pydantic v2 is faster). Dataclasses are faster when I've already validated the data internal transfer is faster and makes more sense to use a dataclass when I just need to move and play around with the data. Additional point database updates I would make a data access layer which would be validated against the schema. I use SQL alchemy here for the models some people use Pydantic here too, optional honestly. This way it makes it easier to unit test too when you abstract everything and loosely coupled.

You can do a lot of cool things with it, like use a TypeAdapter for places where you need different structures that come out of the same API. That being said, I do view it more as an OLTP type tool, it *feels* more row based. For DE tasks, I would reach for DuckDB or polars to read in the API or json data and flatten it.

Every vendor rode that wave, and the race became who can make it easiest to build a report, but that optimizes for a symptom, not the root problem. As more people build reports, each new question gets answered by creating yet another dashboard or a slightly different metric variant, doesn't matter which tool you use because most analytics systems are designed in this way that makes duplication almost inevitable, and it's a ticking bomb because over time the whole thing collapses under its own weight.I’ve been in both setups. In one org, I basically churned out reports on request, where speed was the currency. Stakeholders loved it and tbh it made things easier when it came time to ask for a promotion because output was highly visible. But as the organization grew, the same metrics started showing different numbers across dashboards and eventually we had to go back and pay down the debt we’d accumulated. in my current org, we do the opposite where we lock metric definitions early and invest heavily in the semantic layer. This also means we have to define business logic as code and build composable metrics early on so new questions build on existing definitions instead of spawning new dashboards, new models, and new forks of truth. We also document everything btw. This approach is much slower (and I kinda hate it sometimes), and it’s hard to get buy-in unless the company has a certain level of maturity. Governance is hard to sell when the benefits are mostly “nothing breaks” and “people argue less.” You’ll get challenged on why it takes longer, especially by stakeholders who just want a chart for next week.

nwe8n1x,"After doing this for literally decades I have to say I'm a complete convert to doing as much of this work upfront via Data Contracts as possible: * Data Contracts can define required vs optional columns, their types, their formats (ex: phone numbers with dashes), their min/max values, their min/max string lengths, their enumerated values, and their NULL rules. That contract can be stored in a JSON structure and shared with your upstream source - and then be the basis for their testing and yours. Nothing else will provide as much DQ guarantees as this. And it can be a simple library call to hand over a row/file/table to a utility for checking. * Anomaly-detection is also valuable to do prior to transformation: does your input always have 10 million rows and suddenly you only have 65? Regardless of whether the rows are formatted correctly, you probably have a partial file. Or how about if one of those columns is historically NULL 1% of the time, and that's ok, but now it's NULL 100% of the time. Something has changed...I like doing the above because each of these can typically work with raw data, can catch a ton of problems pre-transform, and isn't much work. Then once you get into the transforms you'll need to do more of the above, but in that case it'll be for items you couldn't check with raw data - like joins that fail because there's suddenly no matching rows, etc.",kenfar,2025-12-28 17:38:18,25,dataengineering,t3_1pxuxev,False,

nwejb5w,"'Pre-pipeline data validation' just sounds like shifting left, no? I'm assuming when you say pipeline, that you are talking about a data ingestion that gets incorporated into your larger existing analytical system. That matches my experience with the schema + CSV issues you are describing.Everything looking fine on the surface but more subtle, complex assumptions about the data being broken post pipeline deployment is something I've run into often. I've had varying degrees of success in trying to proactively identify issues like this. There are a few things that worked for me, particularly when the data source is an external partner. My experience is also in smaller companies where end to end analytics is entirely my responsibility and there is limited support from other colleagues. With that in mind, this kind of validation is imo a balance between getting the pipeline into production quickly and making issue identification and maintenance as easy as possible.**Before building anything / requirements and assumption refinement:*** Get all info about the data source you can * Ask for data dictionaries and/or entity relationship diagrams -> only commonly seen these available in finance but solves 99% of these problems before they happen * Figure out all your critical assumptions and ask about them explicitly (primary keys, important relationships, etc.)* Identify key internal stakeholder(s) that have the business context to clarify expectations * Who can be your point of contact for escalating + investigating issues down the line * Identify what aspects of the data being ingested are critical to *your own* business' processes * Primary keys and most likely a subset of columns/fields rather than everything * That a field exists, is an enum of X possible options, etc. * Things that if your assumption about the data become wrong or broken, then the data becomes unusable or detrimental to the business**While building:*** Codify your critical assumptions * If these are broken pipeline FAILS -> clear alert that mentions you as pipeline owner and your internal stakeholder with a clear business-centric message * Subset of critical fields that must have some characteristics* Quarantine/identify your non-critical assumptions * Should NOT fail the pipeline so that business critical data can still flow * More of a nice to have * If a non-necessary or unused field starts breaking assumptions -> alert that mentions only you as pipeline owner with clear technical context, allows you to create a backlog task which can be prioritized appropriately There's plenty you could do to abstract and reuse a lot of this functionality in whatever your ingestion/orchestration tool you are using but personally I have been unsuccessful in advocating for this internally.I am making plenty of assumptions about the latency requirements, criticality of the data to your business, and that you have some kind of semi-mature ingestion framework with alerting capabilities. This also assumes your destination tables are pre-defined with the pipeline and you aren't using some kind of lakehouse pattern which I have less experience with.

If the data is ""invalid"" by your criteria, can you drop it on the floor? If so, maybe you can validate it at parse time. But typically you try not to do that.Schema drift can be tough to solve without a lot of other metadata you need to either derive by profiling the data, OR having users or your system declare it in absolute terms. Both are tough and have complexity in it that may not be obvious to the users of that data. A pattern I've seen that did okay was to take anything that didn't fit into our target schema, we just threw it into an additional column called `invalid`. From there we can at least write some additional SQL that looks for any records that contain something within `invalid`.At the very least this would provide you (or whoever is using your ingested data) the knowledge that _something has changed_, without knowing exactly what.

Move data through them with ETL (or ELT).-I had to model my data using the Kimble method for my curated version (dimensions and facts). It definitely helps with Power BI reporting. There are lots of resources for this online.- Consider how your API works. When you call it, what does it give you back? Is it a full data set, or do you pass it a date and it just gives you back a smaller set of data? Which columns in that API call do you need and which are definitely not useful to your business (don't get rid of them in raw in case the business wants them in future, but think about if they are needed in cleansed). I was able to use watermarks to record when the pipeline last ran. I can pass that watermark to my API so it only gives me the data that has been inserted or updated since then. That's handy because you process a much smaller data set.-Think about what happens if your pipeline fails at each stage. Draw it out on paper if you have to, think about why parts could fail and how you would fix them or deal with the next pipeline run.- Spend some time thinking how your pipeline will handle deleted data. If someone deleted a record from November in your CRM, how does it need to be handled in your reporting?

Yes, passthrough had some limitations, but it also allowed you to mount storage without baked-in creds, rely on hyperscaler storage security model, and have multiple engines respect a single security model (think what Fabric OneLake aims to achieve today).

There were real tradeoffs made between openness and control, and Databricks obviously chose the latter.

nwjm4j9,"Well - article style is debatable and not really my style. But I have to agree with the actual content. Newer data processing framework or libraries are simpler to use and more scalable without a cluster. THE RACE TO THE BOTTOM:The big data journey started with Hadoop and then Spark came along. Both technologies require clusters of computers with a lot of setup and maintenance. So Hadoop had it moment but mostly disappeared. It wasn’t the right technology for most of the need for enterprises, unless you are Google. Then cloud data warehouse (redshift, snowflake) became popular, but pretty quickly companies had to pay more than they wanted for pretty simple data processing in most parts. But snowflake at least offered a managed service that took away the infrastructure management away from users. A lot of companies still using snowflake for their BI needs and even analytics. Fast forward to data lakehouse architectures. Now we can do the same than in snowflake on files in s3. The clear winner out of this phase was Databricks due to their integrated approach covering end-to-end processing needs. Compared to other approaches it is simpler and managed. Cost of Databricks is cheaper than data warehouses, but we still pay a premium for compute. Now the datalakehouse evolves with on-process DBs like duckdb that offer same performance with much simpler compute for most use cases. This phase is work in progress and lead by DuckDB. But it promises lower cost at similar performance and simpler data stack compared to the 15 year old spark technology. But no end to end platform yet.Data stack is evolving. Throughout the journey performance is increasing slightly or remain the same as the price is of data processing is getting cheaper.",Hofi2010,2025-12-29 13:52:28,2,dataengineering,t3_1py3rg0,False,

nwlyiyi,"Speed and cost are local optimisations. In practice, you’re optimising total cost of ownership and organisational throughput over 5 to 10 years. That brings in other dimensions:**Standardisation and skills** Using one platform for most workloads simplifies hiring, onboarding, and design decisions. Running DuckDB *and* Databricks or Snowflake already means duplicated mental models, tooling, and operational overhead. Spark skills are also far easier to source today than DuckDB-specific expertise.**Usability across roles** A data platform isn’t just for DEs. Analysts, analytics engineers, QA, data scientists, and software engineers all need access. Most don’t want to reason about Python internals or query-level optimisation. Platforms like Databricks and Snowflake work because they provide a shared abstraction layer with escape hatches when needed.**Operations and integration** A “simple VM running DuckDB” isn’t simple in production. You still own OS patching, security hardening, monitoring, backups, scaling, incident response, and integration with IAM, logging, and alerting. That operational load is labour-intensive and expensive.**Compliance and risk management** Enterprise systems must comply with GDPR, ISO/IEC 27001, SOC2, BCBS, etc. Using a certified platform drastically reduces audit scope. Saying “the platform is ISO27001-compliant, we only audit our data logic” is far cheaper than proving compliance for bespoke VM setups.**Support and continuity** At scale, systems fail in non-obvious ways. Having access to vendor engineers who understand the internals matters. Enterprises also care about platform longevity; they expect core infrastructure investments to last 5-10 years, not depend on a small ecosystem or a few experts.Other concerns I’m deliberately not expanding on here include cost attribution, blast-radius reduction, workload isolation and concurrency control, data governance (lineage, column- and row-level security), and long-term exit costs.By the way, I think DuckDB is excellent technology, that's not really the problem here because the question isn’t whether it’s fast or cheap in isolation, but whether it minimises risk, effort, and cost at the organisational level.",sleeper_must_awaken,2025-12-29 20:45:23,3,dataengineering,t1_nwlnfmy,False,

But even then, after you have your prototype running, you should build a relational database based on your MongoDB database.I was led astray. I was one of those naive newbies. I chose MongoDB for my project. At first, I liked it: when I needed to add a field to an object, I add it in my code and it just worked. It felt like magic at first.But after a while, I found out any query more complex than a basic join is a nightmare. Unreadable mess. Absolute degeneracy. My code was full of 100+ lines long unreadable queries decorated with comments like // no way in hell this is the correct way to write this, but it works so DON'T TOUCH ITI thought ""surely I am missing something. Surely there's a way to write the queries more nicely. Surely with more practice, it will get more readable"". But after a while, I realized this was not happening.And the indexing. If you don't have properly set up indexes, the costs skyrocket. And you don't get any sort of warning that the database is manually searching through the millions of entries, checking them one by one for a match, multiple times per query. And even if you have indexes that by all means should have been used, sometimes they just don't get used, without any apparent reason. Optimizing queries is hell.At one point, I had to bite the bullet. I knew I could not keep it at this state much longer. It took me 2 months of tedious work, rewriting everything to Postgres, migrating all the data that accumulated over time. It sucked. But the relief of finally deleting the wasteland that my MongoDB has become was like getting that really bad tooth that has been decaying for 5 years finally pulled. It was awesome.Just use Postgres.

I will say that it scales very well; a cluster of Mongo instances is very malleable, instances can be added, removed and scaled at will without any downtime. Also, since it's schemaless, there's hardly ever any downtime for anything like schema migrations or the like.This comes at quite a cost though. You need to _really_ understand its eventually-consistent model to write code that may be prone to race conditions, where you'd just use locks and/or transactions in other databases. You'll also need to understand its failure modes in edge cases; for example how _exactly_ the retry behaviour of the driver is in case a server instance happens to disappear mid-transaction, and when the application needs to catch that and retry itself.Even if it's schemaless, for most regular applications, you still need a schema. If the database doesn't enforce it, your app layer needs to enforce it. If you don't, you'll end up with _a lot_ of uncertain code all over the place and a lot of `if..else` trying to compensate for vague schemas. Ask me how I know, it's hardly maintainable after a while.For most regular apps which need a relational data store, I would not recommend Mongo. At least not as the primary database. It can be useful for storing a large pool of unrelated, fairly unstructured data which is mostly accessed individually instead of serving aggregate queries.

nwccx3s,"My opinion alone: There is a mindset shift that hasn't happened yet in your brain.Learning to write isn't the same as learning to express yourself. I can teach a toddler to write letters, doesn't mean the toddler can write words. And it doesn't mean the toddler can write a syntactically right and meaningful sentence.Writing is easy. You just put letters one after another. Learning the words is harder, you have to know the words. Making a meaningful sentence is very hard.It requires you to have an idea to express, then choose the right words, in the right orders, with the right nuances to get your listener to understand you.This is all about code here. Learning ""for"", ""if"", ""while"", ""switch"", ""function"", ""null""... All those keywords that have a specific meaning. You know most of them.I guess that if I asked you to write a loop over an array you could achieve it. The issue comes with complexity.You don't know what to express and even if you know what to express, you aren't experienced enough to know how to express it if the complexity rises.From my point of view, if my take makes sense to you, you'll have to work through that. It took me 2 years to get that mindset. It takes more or less time for different people depending on where they start and how efficient their learning process is. You need more time, more practice.Make projects, complex ones. Do some more DSA. Work the problems in your brain, try your solution on the computer, get the result, fix and restart the process. Look on the internet for information and solutions, but don't copy directly, understand and inject the solution in your code, try it, see it, feel it, deeply.On another note: feeling dumber than you thought.

Waterfall strategy only works short term, agile strategy is what separates success stories from failures long term.

nwnncea,"source: Professional Programmer since 1990Here are some skills which, in my experience, help keep people in demand. These are all skills one can learn, hone and master if you want.6. Learn the basics. Understand how computers works, how software works. For instance, what is actually happening when a line of code calls an api function and gets a result? Become familiar with general architectural principles/patterns to help know when to apply what, and to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different tools and frameworks. For instance, understand why certain architectures, languages and frameworks exist, and their pros/cons. Why does C matter in some cases, while in others Python or R might be a better choice? When should you use third-party libraries and frameworks, and when should you not take on extra dependencies? This leads to the next item. 5. Moving comfortably between deep debugging and a wider perspective and knowing when to dive in, when to zoom out, and how to switch quickly between the two.6. Scoping problems quickly. Recognising when you have enough information to act, and when you need to pause and go andlearn more.1. Be good at delivery. Being able to get things done and helping manage your work well. If people can trust you to get things done, they are more likely to want you on their team. Everyone takes time to get better at estimation. Practice getting better by reflecting on why sometimes things took longer/shorter and where you might need to plan better. 2. Knowing when to move fast and accept trade-offs, and when to slow down and lift quality. Knowing to trade off quality, reliability, (all the 'ilities') etc 2. Always be learning. Stay curious about new ideas and whether they make things better or worse. Spending regular time getting hands-on with new technology, techniques, processes and engineering practices matters. There is endless information out there, so be selective, but genuinely interested. Whatever your preferred medium for learning is, make sure you get a good spectrum of quality info3. Being able to step out of the code and talk to senior leaders about risks, benefits and costs. This means understanding the bigger picture well enough to help them make decisions that affect the organisation, without getting lost in detail. You have to be genuinely interested in their problems to really understand them. They will appreciate it generally.4. Bringing technical and non-technical people together to solve problems, both day to day and long term. Knowing who to involve and when is a very great skill. This can be applied whether you're in an org or working in your business for others 7. Being a heavyweight engineer. Someone with N years of deep experience and judgement, not the same year repeated N times.8. Be good at spotting trends and patterns early and calling them out so plans can be adjusted in time. This applies at every level, from yourself and peers, all the way to the big bosses.9. Being a decent person. Don't be the twat that thinks they know everything and treats others with disdain. Even if you do know more, you should treat people with respect. Some will be dicks who don't return the favour, but most people I've found just want to do good work and get on in lif. If you treat them with decency, they are far more likely to help you achieve your goals. 10. Be a producer. Most people are consumers of stuff. If you go out of your way to be a producer. This could be as simple as taking time to share your knowledge with others, or even speaking up in discussions, even to ask questions. You'll be more noticed and more likely to be in their mind when people want to get something done. Often this leads directly to getting better work and with it more impactful rewards. This is a bit of a haphazard list. And you'll see that I've not listed any particular tech. It took me a long time to transition from being quiet and technical to being more interested in the bigger picture and interacting with others more. I really wish I had this list when I was a junior. Overall, this transition, I feel, has made my software engineering much better.",inwegobingo,2025-12-30 02:05:25,12,learnprogramming,t3_1pyu6e8,False,

nww3h12,"I'm gonna tell you something that took me way too long to figure out and honestly still pisses me off that nobody just said it to me directly when I was your age.Stop building shit to impress other programmers. Start building shit that actual people need.You're seventeen, and coded for like 6 years? Cool. I was similar. And I wasted years, like genuinely wasted them building technically complicated garbage that nobody used. I'd make elaborate systems with clean architecture and clever algorithms and other developers would be like ""wow nice"" and I felt smart. But you know what? That's just jerking off. Nobody outside of programmer circles gave a shit because none of it solved actual problems.The real turning point isn't learning another framework or getting better at leetcode or whatever (ofc that's important too at some point). It's when you stop asking ""what's a hard technical challenge I can tackle"" and start asking ""who around me has an annoying problem I could maybe fix"". And I mean really asking. Not imagining problems, not building solutions looking for problems, actually talking to real humans about real annoying shit in their lives.I wish I'd done at seventeen instead of building my tenth todo app with a new fancy tech stack. Go find someone, it can be your parents, a teacher, local business owner, literally anyone, and ask them what repetitive annoying thing they deal with. Then build the dumbest, simplest possible thing that makes that less annoying. Not elegant. Not impressive to other devs. Just useful.For an Example, my friend used to manually copy-paste data from emails into spreadsheets for her work every morning. Took her like 45 minutes. I could've built a script that parsed those emails and dumped it into a CSV in literally an afternoon. But I didn't, because that wasn't ""interesting"" to me. I was too busy implementing a custom database engine for a project nobody would ever use because I wanted to understand B-trees. See the problem? She had a real problem that cost her actual time every single day. I had the skills to fix it in hours. But I never even asked because I was focused on impressing myself and other programmers.This will humble you hard. All that clean code and design patterns everyone is proud of... Nobody cares when they can't figure out how to log in. The clever optimization doesn't matter when they just need a button that exports to Excel because that's what their boss wants. You know what's funny? Even Linus Torvalds had to learn this lesson. When he built Git, he didn't start by designing the perfect distributed version control system architecture. He started because he was pissed off at BitKeeper and needed something that worked for the Linux kernel workflow, specifically handling huge numbers of patches from contributors he didn't fully trust. Git's internals are actually kind of ugly if you look at them. It's basically a content-addressable filesystem with some scripting on top. But it solved the actual problem he had, which was managing kernel development. All the elegant design came later after people were already using it. He built for the problem, not for the architecture. That's why Git won and all those ""better designed"" version control systems nobody remembers lost.Or another time, built an inventory system with proper relational database design, normalized tables, foreign keys, the works. User wanted to bulk-edit 50 items at once. Couldn't do it because I'd built individual edit pages and never thought about bulk operations. They just stopped using it and went back to Excel where they could edit multiple rows. My database design was objectively better than Excel. But Excel let them do their actual job faster, so Excel won.You'll realize pretty quick that like 80% of what you thought was important is completely irrelevant and all the boring stuff you ignored is what actually matters. Authentication, error messages that actually tell you what went wrong, handling edge cases like what if they upload a file that's too big, making sure it works on their old laptop with Chrome from 2019, having an undo button, that's the stuff that makes or breaks whether someone actually uses your thing.This field is packed with people who started young. I've met self-taught developers who picked it up at 25 and they're way better than me at a lot of things because they focused on solving problems instead of collecting technical skills like they're achievements in a video game. There's a guy I used to work with who switched from being a chef at 28, learned to code at a bootcamp, and he's one of the best developers I know. Why? Because he spent 10 years in restaurants learning how to handle stress, communicate with difficult people, and deliver under pressure. Those skills transferred. His code isn't always the prettiest but he ships things that work and people actually **want** to use them.[continuation in the replies]",funkvay,2025-12-31 10:01:02,82,learnprogramming,t3_1q08ir1,False,

I don't move your arms for you - nor do I COMMAND you to open your umbrella, I just have to tell you it's raining. You have autonomy and agency to do whatever is appropriate in response. You could ignore me, you could open your umbrella, you could tell me to buzz off, you could call the police.Objects are a black box that can send and receive messages. In C++, standard streams are the de facto message passing interface, and you have to integrate some of it's interfaces into your implementation - for us, we have implementation level control over the details. In Smalltalk, message passing is a language level feature built right in, which is convenient, which was conventional for the 50s and 60s, but Bjarne took certain issue with that - hence he made C++ the way it is.An object is implemented in terms of state and functions. Your state is typically member fields and objects. Encapsulation *isn't* about tightly coupling functions with **DATA**, it's about classes modeling behaviors by enforcing invariants in member state. Data is bulky and dumb - data doesn't DO stuff. State is an implementation detail. A car has an engine, and so the throttle has to pass a message to the carburetor to accelerate. An engine has an RPM, which is just a number. In C++, you'd mix these types and concepts, in Smalltalk even numbers are objects.Smalltalk is very dynamic and has no type safety. You can ask an integer to capitalize itself; at runtime, it can either ignore the message, or respond with a `:dontknowmessage`, or defer to an exception handler. C++ allows for type safety - another reason Bjarne invented C++, but there's a fair amount of syntax to go with it.Very few multi-paradigm languages get OOP correct. The 1990s were TERRIBLE for OOP. Eternal September came in 1993 - when more people entered comp-sci than the industry as a whole could absorb and mentor them; OOP was oversimplified to the point of being wrong, but the egotistical blind were confidently leading the blind, who couldn't have known better.As a result, you get ""C with Classes"", which is what I'd call most all of it - even in Python. It's actually a strictly imperative style that doesn't have an OOP bone in its body. Getters and setters are a consequence of the C type system, and are often seen in frameworks - but if you're not writing in C, if you're not writing a framework, they're an anti-pattern. Classes model behaviors and enforce invariants - a car can accelerate, turn, stop and start... They can't get make, get model, get year. The car doesn't use those properties to implement it's behavior. Those properties can be associated with the car in a map or table.There are many kinds of polymorphism, and late binding (virtual functions) are just one of them. Javascript has this in spades since you can just ASSIGN additional functions to instances - they are not strictly bound to a prototype. There are several kinds of static and dynamic polymorphisms - function overloading, type erasure, multi-dispatch, overlapping types, indirection...Then inheritance principally models IS-A aggregation or HAS-A composition. There are other types, like C++ has LIKE-A. While neat, inheritance is often misunderstood and misapplied - for everything you might think you want to use it for, presume you're wrong, first.---If you want a book on the subject, the seminal tome is `A Theory of Objects (Monographs in Computer Science)`. Good luck meeting anyone who has ever heard of it, let alone read it. When I tell you you'll likely never meet a developer who has the first clue what OOP is, I mean it. This is our industry's singularly biggest Dunning-Kruger.Note that Java has no de facto message passing interface. Not like Smalltalk. Not like C++. Many languages, like ECMAScript, Java, and C# are so fundamentally wrong about OOP they'll tell you that function calls ARE message passing. Absolutely insane. If that were the case, then Assembly is a first-class OOP language.",mredding,2025-12-29 19:51:37,2,learnprogramming,t3_1pyl0bn,False,

You have a choice: be a dummy like everyone else and call everything Object Oriented - making the term meaningless, or actually understand what it is.I'm warning you that almost everything you're ever going to hear about OOP is wrong. You'll be told that OOP is: public class car { private int speed; public int getSpeed() { return speed; } public void setSpeed(int speed) { this.speed = speed; } }And this is wrong. But everyone SAYS this is right. There is nothing OOP about this code whatsoever. The principles don't make the paradigm, the paradigm makes the principles. In Java, you need to make messages and a mechanism for passing them between objects.You can create objects in Java, but Java isn't inherently Object Oriented. Having objects isn't enough. Fuckin' C has objects - it's explicitly in the language standard, but no one thinks of C as Object Oriented.I want you to have a chance of understanding what OOP is.You won't understand OOP until you study Smalltalk and original materials from the OOP era before the late 90s disaster.

We can throw at you all kinds of tech stacks but what if you pick DevOps over web application development? Or you pick mobile app development over IoT/embedded programming? Perhaps you go for telecom technologies instead?You having finished your first semester is a bit early to make you pick a path and target one or another company. Unless you clearly know what you want to do.Also, your break is going to be what, 1 month or less? It will not be enough to go over all the different paths one might recommend to you.I'd say that if you haven't done yet, then learn to use Git. It will be used regardless in which field you'll be working at. Learn to make pull/merge requests, learn to make feature branches, etc. That knowledge will be needed also in your coming semesters. Try it out with some hobby project (whichever medium: mobile app, a script outputting to a terminal, a website, etc.)Then, you do can map the different technologies that are used by companies in your area. Search by ""junior developer"" or ""junior engineer"" or ""junior software developer"" or such. Yes, you are targeting internship but you'll be working with some tech stack. Even when it comes to very simple tasks they give to interns. You can make a list for mobile app development, a list for web application development, a list for IoT/embedded/hardware programming, etc. Might be that some of the technologies you will learn during your courses. But definitely can be that you might have to learn something on your own or they will teach you during the internship.Another thing that you can do is mapping down all the different companies that are taking interns in first place. You can learn all the different programming languages, but when you have no company to apply to then perhaps you are picking a technology that has no internships in your area. For example you might be learning Python or Java but if companies in your area are taking only interns to embedded programming then you'll need C and C++ instead. So, make a solid plan first before you start picking programming languages, frameworks, etc.You can also look into companies that are hosting open door days, hosting tech talks, etc. Yes, these are not internship events but if you are social enough, you might find internship via connections you make in these events.More realistic approach (instead of looking for internship via tech talk events) is looking if your university has a programming/robotics club. And then join that. These clubs will introduce you into different interesting projects, into different club organized events (but also company visits), and you'll get connections.This is what you realistically can do during your break. You'll have much clearer idea of your options when you start actually applying for internships. Whereas your course mates will be in your current shoes, looking aimlessly for internship offers, not knowing what to do.Sure, it helps if you have a hobby project and you have it in Github and perhaps even hosted somewhere or running on some device (depending of its nature). Then a company will see that you can actually work on a project.Besides an ability to work on a project you also should improve your group work skills / soft skills. This is why I suggested to join some programming related extracurricular activity club in your university. Software development is a group work, usually. Yeah, there is freelancing but you are not targeting it as an intern. An intern must be able to work in a team. I have had different bad experiences with new hires who just do not function in a team. Sure, you can have all kinds of technical skills but if you do not function in a team then it will harm your own progress, it will make you a blocker when it comes to handling tasks, etc. A good intern is somebody who is proactive, shows an interest towards learning, is willing to work in a team, is a good listener, etc.",mandzeete,2025-12-27 00:05:19,7,learnprogramming,t3_1pwhyk8,False,

Hell, I didn't even start a votech until 25.One thing I can suggest to you is to take a step back from programing, and use something like [draw.io](http://draw.io) to map everything out. It doesn't have to be perfect, but you can get a good idea of what's where. Then the implementation is going to be easier, and you can see right off the bat what you can trim. It's also a good exercise in mapping out your edge cases. When you are building something that moves and interacts with the world your primary focus is on not missing a single edge case because people can be hurt and property can be destroyed. Ya dig? Your project isn't likely there yet.I keep several things. A note book, my phone, a couple docs. Then when I'm going through stuff, I make sure I didn't miss these edge cases I noted down everywhere. I generally deal with industrial systems, particularly utilities like ammonia refrigeration, steam boilers, large electrical power systems, large pump systems, etc. So it's not as important for you.Once you have a solid map and the data laid out, what you can/can't do will make more sense I'm sure.

In a new city, they have safety drivers go down each block to do the initial mapping. They also have GPS as backup, and for Google, Streetview as another backup for 3D AR mapping.

nwxfbse,"I’m assuming you’re a beginner and the software you write is not yet complex (ie just print stuff). Because I used to have the same questions when starting out years ago.Dicts and classes are different, but both can be made to do similar things (ie composing objects from scalar types).The difference is that, in most languages, classes provide neat abstraction features, like inheritance and methods, and greater control about how you can use it.Classes can be defined, shaped, and optimized however you like, while dictionaries will just be dictionaries which is optimized for doing 1 thing that is O(1) access time with acceptable storage for the key space.On optimizations, let’s say you’re modeling a square rectangles. With class, you can just define it as having 2 fields like this{ width: int, height: int }Every instance of this rectangle object will cost you 2 ints of memory space. If the int is 64 bit, then your rectangle is just 8+8=16 bytes each, and 10 rectangles will cost you 160 bytes.If you instead wish to use a hash map/dictionary to represent the rectangle with int width and height, that dictionary is probably using much more space than just 2 ints because how hash maps are implemented. If you have multiple such rectangles, it’ll waste more space pretty quickly due to having to initialize mostly empty map to store 2 values. Every insert incur further work as the program needs to hash and potentially resize the haystack or change hash function to fit more keys.Another thing to think about is a dictionary is just a hash map, so its access time is slower than just field access (it has to compute the hash value of the key, whereas with class, the location of the field value within the object is already known).Oh and another thing is with dict/map, you don’t know if you’re gonna have a value at that key unless, you know, you access it. This happens at runtime. With classes, it’s a compile error if you’re accessing the field that does not exist.Last thing is maintainability and DX - with maps, if you decide to change the “key” you’ve been using pervasively like class fields, you’re gonna have to change all occurrences of those string keys. Whereas with classes, your LSP might support renaming that field with just a press on F2. This is very useful when the codebase is huge.Use maps to store values when each key is considered sibling or equivalent to each other, e.g. mapping post codes to region names. Think of it like dynamic lists/arrays, but with key access instead of index access.Use classes to encapsulate more complex objects that you want to extend with methods and your own initialization rules, etc.I’m sure you’ll get it the more complex your program becomes.",artnoi43,2025-12-31 15:35:50,5,learnprogramming,t3_1q0f3qj,False,

Languages that impose strong typing can't usually get away this kind of thing.> for most cases where you need a data-holding object, do you just use a class?This is based on context. There are a few tuple syntax options. There is also a dynamic type which is pretty close to duck typing. Your basic typed options are struct, class and record.

Imagine you have tens of thousands of lines of code and a pivotal object just changed structure. Perhaps a value that was once a string is now a number.

nwxf2xp,"So I think you are misinterpreting what a class is; a class is a language-based concept that allows you to create custom data structures that also have behavior (or member functions) attached to it. This allows you to make ANY data structure that you want that follows the rules of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Classes allow a language to be called object oriented, since in object oriented programming, the focus is on creating more and more of these data structures which when declared in code are called objects, hence object oriented programming.A dictionary is a data structure. So you can for instance create your own dictionary class implementation, though I’m sure one exists in the C# STL. So two completely different things essentially; a class/object is a programmer-implemented data structure with associated behavior(s) attached which follows the 4 laws of Object Oriented Programming, and a dictionary is a data structure that if you really wanted to you could implement that.As for your second question, explicit type declarations are very important in the programming world because they essentially allow one to know at all times a general idea of how many bytes/chunks of memory a variable is taking up, as well as help with avoiding implicit type conversions which can cause a lot of issues. You won’t see this come up much as a beginner but the second you start working on anything that’s a bit complex, you will see why this is a big deal. This was something that I struggled with when I started in JavaScript, as the dynamically interpreted types would lead to really odd behavior at unexpected times. This becomes more apparent the further you get towards the hardware; python is built upon a great deal of layers to emulate natural language to its best ability, whereas in C/assembly you are dealing with extremely explicit operations that having a byte offset could cause the entire program/system to crash. To give even more explicit control for this reason, you will later see C/C++ users will use even more strict types like uint_32 and long long or even stranger looking types to someone who has never used lower level programming languages. Also, tbh, it just helps with readability, being able to know exactly what each type is defined as.As far as running a script, anything dealing with Windows is gonna be a pain in the ass (I’m an arch Linux user if u can’t tell by my windows cynicism) but it’s what u gotta do since C# is .NET. But essentially all the stuff u did in VS is just for programmer ease of mind, but really thats just an automation tool. Hell if you want to just open up a terminal and run a script real fast all you gotta do is type dotnet run [name of program].cs And it will run it. VS generates a ton of metadata files to help with the building process which is why it’s a pain in the butt to set up but once you do it will make it a little faster.Anyways do you have any other questions? I hope I explained well, I use a great deal of Java but I’m mostly a C/C++ developer so much different domain but still same concepts",C_Sorcerer,2025-12-31 15:34:36,1,learnprogramming,t3_1q0f3qj,False,
nwxityq,"Now, why use namespaces when it’s such a hassle? Why don’t we put everything in 1 file or 1 folder and have automatic access to code written in other files?TLDR: it’s for organizing large codebase. We can separate different concerns with namespaces.If you have organized folders for other computer files/works, why not source code?You probably don’t feel the need to modularize your code into modules/namespaces because your program is not yet complex enough.Imagine if we work at Google, with millions of lines of code. And now you want to name something specific to some implementation, maybe you want to implement search result for a TV. There’s a very high chance the name “SearchResult” is probably used somewhere in there. Without namespaces, we must come up with new names every time we want something different, like “SearchResultMobile”, “SearchResultMobileWeb”, “SearchResultTV”, and so onWith namespaces, each names or symbols are confined to only have meaning in its namespace, so you can have mobile.SearchResult, mobile_web.SearchResult, and tv.SearchResult instead. All code relating to TV implementation will live in the namespace “tv”, not cluttering other namespaces.Namespaces help separate concerns, and the “import” part is explicit - you have to define wht and where you want to bring symbols outside of our namespace (eg folder, in Go) into scope, to avoid you running/compiling code accidentally (which might be malicious or just bugs).My example might not be good, but at least it demonstrates the point.My tips: Whenever you are asking why programmers do stuff the way they do, imagine you have to work with big ass codebase (100k LoC++) with incompetent coworkers, and maintain that code for years, then you’ll understand why.",artnoi43,2025-12-31 15:53:19,1,learnprogramming,t3_1q0f3qj,False,

nwr6atc,I'm an engineer with a physics background and I'm currently a professional Haskell developer.There's this common trope that software engineers want to retire to become farmers after a few years in the business. I don't feel that way after almost ten years as a professional dev.I think it's because the imperative nature of most mainstream languages will have you rewriting the same for loops over and over again. Object oriented programming promised that you could reuse code but that never really paid off and so a lot of people are feeling disillusioned with the promises of programming.I think Haskell gives you a much better way of actually reusing code. The way it does it is by using algebra on the type level. I very much enjoy the process of figuring out the types first and then the implementation often comes naturally from that. It's much closer to math or pure logic than imperative programming.I haven't tried too many other functional languages so I can't speak for them. I did try F# and it felt like a bastardized version of C# which I'm already not very fond of after working with it for three years.All of this is rather subjective but there seems to be a broad agreement when it comes to Haskell that it's very elegant and has a very steep learning curve.If you have a strong math/logic background and you're looking to enjoy the process of writing code rather then enjoying running the program then I think Haskell is for you.With that said I'm not sure if modelling physics is the best way to enjoy functional programming.,AxelLuktarGott,2025-12-30 16:35:00,1,learnprogramming,t3_1py4cgf,False,

Now about the tips:-do not implement stuff until you fully understand the logic behind it. Its really hard to debug a physics engine if you dont know how the state is supposed to look at each step of the process.

Something that lets you visualize stuff like the vertices, lines, bodies, variables, etc. Do not debug by guessing whats happening.-start small, make you engine by breaking it down into its smallest parts and making sure each small part works and connects easily to the rest of the code (like legos). Using assertions helps but im not sure the general opinion on assertions.-dont be against looking at the industry standard solutions. For example, if you are dealing with colision detection, trying to make your own version instead of just looking up the already existing algorithms (aabb, gjk, sat) is most likely going to take you longer and give you a worst result.

Knowing what to write and build is important. If you give either to an unpredictable AI… what is left?And no, AIs (plural, it’s not a singular thing) can’t build much - let alone “anything.” They require a lot of handholding, create bad code, keep adding instead of fixing or modifying, have no idea how to do a lot of things and so on.Anyone saying they can do “anything” or “a lot” is always doing basic menial copypastable CRUD stuff etc. Stuff that has been done myriads of times so the LLMs can just vomit it out.

Imagine wanting to skateboard and instead of taking things slow and mastering the basics you grab a long board and set yourself downhill. How do you see that ending? I used Claud code opus 4 for 3 months with context management and barely got any utility out of the code! This is after pouring countless hours in code refactoring cleaning and restructuring to reduce slope and keep the project manageable. At one point I deleted about 80% of the entire code base without any change to functionality! AI cannot reason! It can only fake reasoning. A more appropriate denomination for the technology would be pseudo intelligence! It generates a lot of slop and then takes that slop as input to generate even more slop!

You build skill and code you can rejse this way, which again speeds up things.This stage, the only use of AI should be to get things explained, so you can try to implement it. Later on you start using it for all the boilerplating, so you can focus on the actual task, but never to write everything. This is the point where you start to feel productive. I'm a backend dev and architect, so might be someone to better say. But i would say yes, fullstack is still very relevant, but it will probably shift to something where you get you basic layouts and again boilerplating for a site generated, and then you spend time writing the code, that requires more domain specific knowlegde, which AI's have no clue about.And in any case, just learning about an area will get you ahead of someone just prompting away for the same result, because you can read it and apply it elsewhere.

nwl32ul,"Great initiative. Learning structure early prevents ""spaghetti code"" later. Here is the standard approach for small-to-medium projects:1. The Gold Standard StructureAdopt the src layout. It keeps your actual code separate from configs and tests. project_name/ ├── .gitignore # Ignore venv, __pycache__, .env ├── README.md # Documentation ├── requirements.txt # Dependencies ├── src/ │ ├── __init__.py │ ├── main.py # Entry point │ ├── config.py # Settings │ └── utils.py # Helper functions └── tests/ # Test files mirroring src structure **2. When to Split into Modules*** **The Scroll Rule:** If you find yourself scrolling up and down constantly to find a function, split the file.* **Cognitive Load:** If a file handles Database logic *and* UI logic, split them. Keep files focused on one ""domain"" (e.g., [`database.py`](http://database.py), `api.py`).* **Reusability:** If you need a function in two different scripts, move it to a shared `utils` module.**3. Patterns to Learn Early*** **The Entry Guard:** Always wrap your execution logic. This prevents code from running if you import the file elsewhere. Pythonif \_\_name\_\_ == ""\_\_main\_\_"": main() * **Virtual Environments:** Never install libraries globally. Always use `venv` (or `poetry`/`uv`) for every project.* **Type Hinting:** Start using standard type hints (e.g., `def greet(name: str) -> str:`).

nwbap77,"I worked for medical device companies for 15 years, think of devices like a dialysis machines and wearable insulin pumps. While they are trying to help people, the company was still run in a way that I didn't find that great as an employee. They sell candidates on the idea that their work is going to help sick people and how it is a privilege for you do be working there.It's such a privilege that you should take 20% - 30% below market to work there. That money you leave on the table is said to be reinvested back in to the company, but it really just goes in to the CEO's theoretical pockets.You would think that you can at latest create great devices for patients to use with rich features and so forth. The reality is you meet bare minimum FDA standards for a safe product and go no further. The problem at the companies I worked for is that you were not selling to the end user.You are making money from insurance companies on things like disposable components that you change each treatment. A dialysis machine is expensive and the vast majority of people on dialysis are paying for it with insurance and not out of pocket. That means investing on making a really nice UX is not any priority.At the companies I worked at they don't make extra money investing a lot of time and effort on a well thought out UX, weather that is the UI or the physical device. From what I saw you give them the bare minimum and call it done. All the time and money is really in the patient safety aspects of the device.As long as you don't kill people having them need to click some extra buttons to start their treatment or wait a little longer for treatments to complete is ok, because when you have kidney failure the choices are using the device or die while you wait for a kidney transplant.This could just be the companies I have worked at and not what other companies do. And the old idea that shitty companies won't make money and go out of business wasn't my experience. These companies have been around since the early 80's and making money hand over first.All of the devices were designed in a way to require constant payments from insurance companies through components that needed to be replaced periodically, if not after each treatment. Oh and who makes these components with custom connections that only fit our devices? Oh we do, so buy them from us!Yes after 20 years or something like that when the patent experiences it is a free for everybody to use, but at that point the company has already released other medical devices, with new patents, and different special connections. So it's just a constant cycle of making money.So are these companies evil? No, no directly.

Probably like 20-30 applications. I came from a prestigious school but was not (and am not) exceptional as a developer. I got fired from my first job for poor performance and had a new one lined up a month later. Interviews were a breeze compared to today. A simple phone screening, and a single 2-4 hour in person round. Maybe half the interviews I did involved some light whiteboarding.In 2006 I decided I wanted to live a different place and started interviewing for new opportunities. It was so easy to get offers. In March 2006 I had three offers to choose from after interviewing over a span of a couple months. I choose poorly and so in August I started interviewing again. And again, I ended up with three offers to choose from by the end of September.In 2008-2010, like 60% of developers at my company were laid off. I barely missed the cut because I got lucky and transferred to a strategic project just before my old team got decimated. But everyone I kept in touch with found a new development job within a few months at most.In 2018 I got laid off and had two job offers within a month. Interviews were a little more challenging than they had been in 2006 but still stupid easy compared to today. Things seem to have become so much more cutthroat since then.

nwv5fb9,"I dropped out of school in Jan 2000 as I was offered stock options for AutoDesk’s web start up. The first crash happened 2 months later. I’ve worked steadily since then in the industry. The **2000** one was wildly different because we didn’t communicate well on a global scale at that point. Prior to the crash, I heard stories of people making it rich in tech, but generally tech wasn’t all that well respected. The average person wasn’t using the internet for a ton. My out of college salary was 38k if I remember correctly. The prediction was the options I got would be worth 350k, which was more money than I’d ever dreamed of. (Spoiler: They were worth 0). The crash happened, the company failed, people were laid off. That part was similar to now. Everyone was just waiting for it to be their turn, comparing themselves to their peers. Fearful. I eventually took a job working for the government for 34k. Getting a job was hard. There was a fear that this internet thing was just a fad and we’d struggle to get pretty mediocre pay. Still, I wasn’t super nervous. I got into it for engineering and if all I did was write C++ Windows apps forever, that was fine at the time. For me, things started returning to normal in \~2004 when my original company had been sold and asked me to come back for 63k / year. I took the job and worked there until 2012.By the **2006** crash I felt more like a mid level engineer. The *economy* felt bad, but in my corner of the world it felt like everyone knew tech was the future. Things were still optimistic for me. There were still layoff fears, but we didn’t really have any and my company was pretty stable. What feels different to me this time? It’s been an employees market for a long time and that’s changing. I know so many people who have made more than your average doctors do. Hell, I do and I’m a college dropout. It feels to me like this could be a huge realignment if it continues. How long do I think it will last? My personal, uneducated guess is that companies will shift back to wanting engineers. At some point they’ll realize the tools can multiply their productivity (Not replace it) and at that point they’ll want more people and produce more faster. I think this will come in the next 2-3 years likely? At the same time, I think some damage here has been done. You need a job more than it needs you and I think it could take a long time for that to shift back completely (If it ever does). I don’t actually thing we’ll see the boom at the level of \~2018. Or at least I won’t. Maybe you will!In the early 2000s I saw a ton of people who got into software to “Get rich quickly”. They took an online course and called themselves web developers because they could “Save as HTML” in word. A lot of them shifted real estate agents or other jobs. I think we’ll see the bottom of the industry drop out like that again. What helped me survive? Uh. I’m a hard worker. Probably a bit of a boomer take (I’m Gen X), but I’ve always been very professional. I saw so much shit that I wouldn’t pull during the late 2010 boom era. Don’t get entitled.

My interview was canceled before it was scheduled because they decided to stop all new grad hiring. - MIT Lincoln Laboratory. This was basically a defense contractor job.

What's more, a company actually needs the junior to stay once they've been leveled up, which certainly isn't a guarantee as engineers tend to hop companies regularly. That's a loss for the company who invested in training junior engineers if they do not benefit from the higher quality and quantity output from mid+ years. If you just let other companies hire and train up juniors, then you can snap up the good ones that make it without the training costs.",PartyParrotGames,2025-12-29 09:16:47,22,cscareerquestions,t3_1pyh4mq,False,

If you just focus on the interview skills, it's going to be difficult to really come across as an experienced engineer without the projects and wins on the job to back it up.Here's how I did it: 1. Take jobs at increasingly larger or better paying companies. You might not go ""small"" -> ""big tech"" in one jump, but push your limits and apply to scale-up companies with solid VC funding and lots of ex-big-tech employees. 2. Take every leadership opportunity you can, especially those unpaid ""tech lead"" or ""team lead"" spots. You're paycheck doesn't reflect the extra responsibility, but you're experience will be considerably better, and that should come across in interviews. 3. If you don't have a CS degree, go get your masters. This will accelerate how fast you grow as a junior/mid level engineer, and get you the technical profeciency to be a senior much faster.

nw06iyf,"Ok, the rest of reddit seems to be outside of the track and I will provide you with real experience from my point of view:High performance programming is definitely real and highly desirable. Usually it's called ""real time programming"" or High performance computing (HPC). It involves supercomputer or regular computer to solves problem or process immense amount of data. Or it could be low latency code. Anything that is not web based usually will be subject to a tighter ressources allocation and thus performance being more important. Think of something mass produced, throwing 50$ more for better ram because you produced shit code and the price of the product is around 50$... It's just not acceptable.A real life example:Sicentific computing is usually very computing heavy for things like simulations or lots of dimensional processing (think RGBs processing but on 280++ channels instead of just 3). These sometimes have tight performance requirements such as processing before another data package is generated. My job is essentially that. I take bleeding edge reasearch code in python made by physicist and optimize the shit out of it so it takes little to no time to process. Initially the processing time was 18h ++ per dataset and now it's down to sub 2h making it so that we process faster than we acquire. This means it's processed in real time and you can have the results immediately which is neat for aviation decision, threat detection and all stuff highly critical.Usually it will require you to work with people of other domain which is very fun I think. You become good at physics, geospatial and other math heavy domain which makes leetcode feels even more stupid (because the time/space complexity is not all you look for in performance computing and usually one of the easiest thing to optimize). Overall, it's a very rewarding field as you may be recruted for satellites, geospatial, lots of physics project that are bleeding edge, quantum computing, etc.",Aware-Individual-827,2025-12-26 10:23:02,11,cscareerquestions,t3_1pvwuzd,False,

nvwglc5,"\> being on mobile just seems like being a super small part of the projectI think there's something more to be said about this. It sounds to me like you are thinking in terms of android apps that are front-ends (effectively, websites). Thus, your logical conclusion is that to gain 'more depth' and employability, you should develop expertise in all parts of the application (i.e., backend).I want to challenge that point of view, and emphasize a few job-niches where smartphone apps really leverage the local computing power of a Snapdragon-level processor. In these cases, the app is not only a *part* of the project, it is *integral*. The android expertise you have is incredibly valuable for this use case.Take [ATAK-Civ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atakmap.app.civ) for example. It is a micro-ecosystem of apps and plugins that are used as tools for first-responding and security. Companies develop ATAK plugins using standard android tools, to do things like build software controllers for drones within ATAK, or stream health data from smartwatches of field operatives.Alternatively, Android (the operating system) is used by some companies for their own non-smartphone products. I recently interviewed with a company that builds treadmills. The treadmills use stock android for their OS and applications to serve standard functionality to their users and control hardware.These are small companies, sure. There are hurdles to finding these, especially since you're not in the US. You will have to do research to find such companies. And they may pay less than a large company like the one you're at, because the scale of the revenue they generate is going to be intrinsically smaller (the other side of that coin is that the revenue is shared with fewer individuals, so you may actually get paid pretty well anyway). But they are working on *cool shit,* and they want experts in the tools to help them do so.Source: I am one of those guys working on cool shit",eebis_deebis,2025-12-25 18:10:48,14,cscareerquestions,t3_1pvi2vo,False,

My 2 cents:The startup will make you better at building things quickly, give you access to way more interesting problems, and also allow you to have more responsibility than you ever would at big tech. The tradeoff is that it’s the wild west. Coding best practices, well-scoped projects, clear roadmaps, internal tooling, may be minimal or nonexistent. That’s not inherently bad, and it can make shipping much easier, but there is less support in ensuring you’re writing good code, so it can very much be a sink-or-swim environment. I have learned much more in less time at my startup than I had at my previous big tech job, but my big tech job was very important in teaching me what large-scale corporate software development looks like: what guardrails are important, what good docs and code look like, how to navigate corporate politics, etc. I also think unfortunately brand name does matter and it was helpful to get my foot in the door when I started looking for jobs, but that can be overshadowed by building cool stuff.So my main advice is to do your best to learn best practices in software development, and actively look for someone who is experienced and can mentor you.",JustJustinInTime,2025-12-31 18:55:11,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1pz6gqd,False,

If you start preparing early, build a few solid projects, and apply consistently, you’ll be in a good spot..",Boom_Boom_Kids,2025-12-31 12:14:14,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1pzwxgr,False,

nwf68z2,Hi all looking for some feedback on my resume -- my interview rate has gone down a bit since November. I'm targetting full stack or backend roles for intermediate or junior/entry depending on the company as my current company is a service based not product. Id love to break into a big tech company - not FAANG but anything adjacent or similar that will open future doors. Please provide any feedback - appreciate it and happy holidays![https://imgur.com/a/MMH8AAM](https://imgur.com/a/MMH8AAM),MrKrabs_bangs_Sandy,2025-12-28 20:17:25,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1pwsev9,False,
