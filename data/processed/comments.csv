All the cdc pipelines work great, and I haven't had any issues.I have to ask, how come you can't use mirroring for your on-prem sql? Or at least spark if not mirroring.For the front end, I just approached it via segmentation of capacity. So, each business domain only throttles themselves.

Every single actor and library involved has to be aware of this transactional mode or else you will see duplicates. It's not worth it.And even in at-least-once, you need to discuss beforehand the need for timeouts, heartbeat adjustments, the need for an idempotency/deduplication ID and event_time parameter... Applications tend to just be set up with default parameters without discussing any of that which is a recipe for headaches. Hell, I've seen deployments without as much as a group ID set up saying ""hey it worked without it"".

Everyone rushed pushing pipelines into production without proper models, processes, conventions and standards in place. Data Modeling is not easy skill to obtain and requires lot of effort, time and multitude skills. My current teams uses data vault and dimensional modeling frameworks, it takes time to get to final data marts and views on top but we rarely have pipeline issues (DBT, Snowflake). We spend lot of time upfront, which saves lot of money and reduce development time and effort down the line, which is the right way of doing things. When we face any ELT issues, then we go back to the data model and analyze on how to de-couple, optimize the model without breaking the grain at times. It saves lot of load times in some of those big fact tables.  The issues I also noticed and I made those mistakes as well, shove tons of metrics into a fact table and calculate them at the fact table level. Instead those metrics should be calculated at one layer up (business vault or raw vault) layer and just load them as is into fact table. Fact table should be a simple select * from xyz tables. There's so many things that can go wrong in a pipeline and data model can solve many of those. We normally do a hands off to our DE's of our data models and mapping docs, it makes their life whole lot easier and efficient at times.",69odysseus,2026-01-14 19:28:06,32,dataengineering,t3_1qcw5qe,False,

nzmhzf6,"Totes. The idea that we don’t need modelling anymore could only be pushed by people who have no clue what they are on about, or grifters trying to sell you bullshit snake oil. Unfortunately CTOs will lap it up because data modelling takes time and expertise, and therefore money. AI produces superficially easy results that appear reasonable enough on first glance. But AIs don’t actually know anything about your business so they will confidently tell you things that are completely wrong, or which are true but not the correct answer to your question. Data modelling is not primarily a technical discipline, it is about extracting human-understandable meaning from what is otherwise just a bunch of ones and zeroes. It requires understanding your business deeply, and understanding what the business cares about and needs to measure.  This meaning is often not directly available in your raw data. You have to translate it for a business user.Now this is where the AI grifters will tell you “oh sure the AI isn’t great at that now but it’s going to get better with better models”. And sure, it will. But even when you have better models that can more accurately translate the user’s intent into a correct answer, you will still have the problem that each individual user is having a separate conversation with an AI. Bob might ask for revenue figures for last month, the AI asks him how to define revenue and gives him a correct answer based on his definition. Jenny has a separate conversation with the AI and gives a slightly different definition and the AI gives her a correct but DIFFERENT answer. So how do you fix this situation and ensure that Bob and Jenny get the exact same answer for revenue? You have to make sure there is a source that has the correctly calculated and verified definition of revenue ready for the AI to use. And what do we call this process? Data modelling!If anything, data modelling only gets more important in the age of AI. Since in the past when you had highly technical data and BI analysts answering the questions for you, you could rely on them having enough knowledge and expertise to work around the complexities and problems of the data. But in a world where every Bob, Jenny, and Harry with no technical knowledge expects to be able to ask the AI for answers themselves, you better be damn sure that it is working off a highly curated and verified source.",evlpuppetmaster,2026-01-14 22:28:43,7,dataengineering,t3_1qcw5qe,False,

nzn85x3,"Data modeling always has been and always will be important. It's not just one pattern though, it's sticking with whatever pattern makes sense for your company and ensuring it doesn't end up in a pile of irreconcilable shit. I don't see a huge reason to do dimensional modeling anymore other than your downstream tools may like it and it's useful if you have a lot of cross-subject rate calculations that benefit from conformed dimensions. A lot of businesses don't need that though and are fine with stuff like OBTs and master data and those help them move faster.I am also skeptical that we are going to see a lot of usefulness with LLMs and data any time soon. I think AI is very useful as a tool to help build pipelines and tools, but not as much for accessing data right now. Data models can be massive with lots of tables, columns and semantic descriptions for the content, so you end up flooding the context window and confusing the model (most of which is irrelevant context to the problem). A lot of the definitions are weird so don't align well with the model's training and people also ask the same question 20 different ways, which can lead to inconsistent answers. The way I have seen people trying to make AI systems that work is by slowly building up the model and keeping it small (i.e. not the enterprise model you are used to). So in the end it can only answer simple questions like ""tell me how much revenue we earned from product X in the last three months"". Given how much time you spend building and tuning the model until you feel like it works most of the time, isn't it faster to just give them a dashboard with the same capability and better accuracy? Also the user community is thinking that they will be able to prompt the model to do a deep dive that an analyst would spend a week on and that's just not reality.",Gators1992,2026-01-15 00:46:53,3,dataengineering,t3_1qcw5qe,False,

I came from being a controller to being a data analist/scientist to being a n00b data engineer but i can tell you one thing from my domain expertise, data modelling is key for success in any organization that leans heavily on data.

Departments will build their own vision on top of the mess you supply them with. I had a discussion lately with a professor ranting how multiple versions of the truth can coexist but believe me, companies just want 1 version. In the end, you don't want to have senior level management have a discussion in a meeting about what a cost center is, what data is correct, on what date FTE stats are calculated for reports and what the source is of all of this (that, in effect, will surge your indirect costs, drop the trust in your solution and eventually have management question why in gods name they hired those engineers).",Crazy-Sir5935,2026-01-15 08:30:18,3,dataengineering,t3_1qcw5qe,False,

nzwk9gw,"100% agree but in the past 6 months AI agents have really changed how my team and I work.As I was writing the stuff below I realized it became too long... so here's a summary.TLDR; going from first using agents to improve our data pipelines and stack, to eventually creating a more self-service system where our data consumers use AI agents to interact with the data. For some context, I'm leading the DE team of 4-5 people (1 mid/senior, 1 junior, 2-3 interns) at a company where our end product is predictions for highly specialized industries (e.g. renewables, transportation).At first it started with using our data platform's MCP with cursor to just lookup documentation, then I started asking cursor to read our data pipelines and query the dwh directly to find the specific part of a query or script that was causing some issue.But in the past couple months, after creating some extensive agent rules/instructions documentations as well as creating a md file for each pipeline that contains some business context, I have been able to fully rely on cursor to build pipelines or make major changes.A recent example is that I spent \~1 hour creating a details requirements document that I gave as the prompt, the agent make changes to \~10 files (mostly sql models and some yml configs and a python ingestion script). About 3-4 hours of back and forth with the agents to make some adjustments, update documentation, and runs tests and validation. The entire process was done in a single workday, whereas normally this would've been 2-3 days of work.Its not always about ""saving"" time for me but rather its about doing things the ""better"" way - a clear example of this is having the agents create/update documentation, build/run tests, perform adhoc validations, etc. which translates into time saving in the futureI know what I've said above is not related to ""AI on top of broken data stack"", but the reason why I'm talking about how AI is helping data engineers is because I think it that is the sole reason/contributor to speeding up the process of fixing and improving our data stack.By fully utilizing the combination of cursor, mcp integrations, internal rules/instructions/context documents, and access to query our data warehouse, we were able to ""slap AI on top of our data"" as in:\- other teams (i.e. data science, software engineering, product, etc.) to also close our data engineering repos and have conversations with cursor to ask it about the logic behind data models (e.g. does table\_xyz contain data from source\_abc? how often does table\_xyz get updated? what is the calculation method for kpi abc?)\- integration of an AI Slackbot (provided by our data platform provider) that queries our dwh and returns insights - as a result, we have seen people in data science, sales, execs, etc. move away from using dashboards and instead asking the slackbot directly inside threads things like ""what was our prediction accuracy last week?"" ""how did model A perform vs model B last year?""I think this only became possible because we were able to quickly (within 2-3 months) clean up our data pipelines and data models, create a lot of documentation and context for AI to utilize, and break down the barrier between data consumers and the data itself - this way as the data engineering team, we are no longer a bottleneck and things have finally trending towards the ""self-service"" utopia we've always dreamt about.",uncertainschrodinger,2026-01-16 11:44:01,3,dataengineering,t3_1qebb1m,False,

The idea behind this Postgres offering is to bring them even closer together and make that integration as effortless as possible for developers. :)With regard to integration, the vision behind our CDC capabilities is to offer a much more native experience, something you can’t get from other services and addresses problems around standard CDC. Additionally, the `pg_clickhouse` extension will be native to this service and maintained by ClickHouse, and will act as a unified query layer for both transactional and analytical workloads.

Then after that, become familiar with at least one major cloud provider. AWS, Azure, GCP. Be strategic here. I’ve noticed specific industries prefer one vs the others. Your data analyst background should have given you ample knowledge on how to create tables (ideally in sql, but I think understanding excel tables and pivot tables help too). Data exploration is an important skill, but understanding schemas and how they fit together is the crucial part. Your data analyst background should help with data modeling as well. Try to focus on roles that highlight these things in the job description. Also be aware that there are different flavors of data engineers. Being analytics focused means you’re more on the business intelligence and dashboarding side. Highlight your storytelling and data vis exp.

o000aw7,"Some advices for the start: start small (one or few data sources / pipelines), dont overengineer (dont try to cover every possible edge case), build stuff that it is easy to tear down, build LOOSELY coupled pieces (this way you avoid one small thing breaking upstream and blocking everything downstream), spend a good time sketching diagrams and noting down pros and cons for every architectural decision (important: there's not one perfect choice. Best-practice in terms of this kind of thing is to know the trade-offs), implement observability from day 1 (that can be writing logs and checking them daily in cloudwatch at the start).Note that MANY of your trade-offs and architectural decisions will depend on what kind of requirements are required downstream. In fact, the very first thing you need to map is who are the data consumers and what are their needs - mind you that more often than not the end-users have very vague requirements (it is often a big part of the job to translate vague business requirements into technical choices - also, often what they want is different than what they need). If applicable to your case: also talk to upstream stakeholders (feks, in my company, the data is generated by services written by developers, so I have to sync with them to understand what is doable or not in terms of data serving/latency)EDIT: also, if you are not super familiar with AWS, dont underestimate how much time you'll spend implementing things there :D(I'm in a similar position, where I wear the architect, tech lead and engineer hat at the same time - and oh, Iam also brazilian ;) )",maxbranor,2026-01-16 21:49:02,19,dataengineering,t3_1qeoqfo,False,

o0hrah2,"I'm in a team that built everything on AWS services, with similar amounts of incoming data.It was fine at first. As long as everything was simple with a single region and incoming product, and a few people had been working on it and had direct experience with how everything was done, then the 'quirks' were kept to a minimum and everyone knew them.Then as new team members got onboarded things got harder. People had to be taught all the quirks of which role to use when creating a glue job vs an interactive notebook, they had to be shown the magic command boilerplate to get glue catalog and iceberg tables working, they needed to know the bucket that was set up for output for Athena queries. With more people working not everyone could be across everyone else's work, so people weren't familiar with how various custom jobs and scripts had been made, and because each job was its own mini vertical stack there was a lot of repeated components in infrastructure, policies, ci/cd scripts.As new use cases came on that didn't fit the mould new ways of doing things had to be added. Kinesis and firehose come in, airflow orchestration gets tasked for some small transforms while others go to glue jobs. Someone wants a warehouse/database to query, so redshift is added. Exports to third party processors are needed as are imports, so more buckets, more permissions. API ingestions are needed so in come lambda functions, with each one coded and deployed differently because nobody can see what everyone else is doing.Then finally users need access to data, and the team just isn't set up for it. There is no central catalog with everything, it is spread out across half a dozen services, and the only way to know where anything is or goes is to dig through the code. That 'worked' for the DE team, since they were the ones doing the digging, but there was no effective way to give access to everything. Every request for data took days or weeks to finalise, and often required more pipelines to move it to where it could be accessed.We're moving to Databricks soon. It gives a unified UI for DE and other teams to access the data, you get sql endpoints, you can run basic compute on single-node 'clusters', it has orchestration built in, it gives you a somewhat easier way to manage permissions, and it works for both running your own compute and giving data access. Instead of a mishmash of technologies that don't make a unified platform, you get a consistent experience.You'll just have to pay extra since it is doing a good portion of that unification work for you.If you had a hundred DE type roles it might be more cost effective to stick with base aws services, and have a dedicated team focused on dx, standards, and productivity, to cut out the managed compute cost.

I have experience with spark, orchestration, A.I. Agents, etc. Databricks can do everything you listed. It is not the best in each category. Airflow is a superior orchestration tool than Databricks Workflows, for example. However Databricks provides tools in all categories that are more than good enough.I find myself surprised how easy most things are. I usually do a POC with a G.U.I. first. Then reimplement with code, checking against the G.U.I. POC as I go. There is a G.U I. for Databricks Workflows and A.I. Agents. In general, everything seems to be as easy as possible, with good default settings. The advantage of having good enough tools in broad categories that all integrate well with each other makes life easy.Measured against AWS, Databricks is more expensive. Your company can either pay more for compute ( go with Databricks) or pay more to expand the team with specialized people (AWS). Expensive compute is cheaper than expensive specialists.Plus Databricks is moving to everything runs on serverless. In practice, I would say 80% to 90% of prod code runs on serverless. I see this improving with time.Closing remark. Databricks is a thought leader. They have made many open source software that everything else is compared to. (Spark, MLflow, DeltaLake,...). Databricks competitors run Databricks open source software. Agent bricks hosts 20+ LLMs out of the box.

o0hwzba,"I built up a data lakehouse architecture starting 5 years ago and we had to stich AWS services together. Which worked well and performance was inline what we needed. We used all of the technologies you listed except data tone and only a bit of lake formation. Then we wanted to have a business facing data catalogue with lineage and there wasn’t much available in AWS. As of 2026 I would argue that is still the case. For data catalogue we used OpenMetadata. For hosting we used EKS btw.Long story short it takes a lot of development effort to put all of these technologies together and to maintain it. It works well once done and it is scalable. But if I would do it again I would use Databricks in 2026. Gets you started quickly. Downside will be cost as you have to pay for DBUs on top off AWS cost. Arguably you would need less data developers which could pay for the additional cost. I know this is a bit off a sticking point nobody wants to think about. But if you plan to use your devs to build the AWS solution then you already covered the dev cost. If you go with Databricks you may need less data devs, assuming that some part of their time is currently used for infrastructure work. If the new AWS architecture would need more devs than the argument would be that Databricks would allow you to operate with the current number of devs.If you decide to go with databricks use an open source table format like iceberg to reduce vendor locking.

So, can you do all those things yourself? Probably. Is it worth doing those all yourself when you could be focused on delivering solutions for the business especially as a smaller team? Likely not, but that also depends on the current skill level of your team and the level of infrastructure you’ll have to maintain.

These are solved by data. databases, warehouses, SQL, BI, semantic layers. The other one is process / logic / workflow. This is things like ""what sales actions should I take with this customer over the next 3 months to improve my chances of a win?"" Or ""what data should I use to answer this question?"" These are solved by different kinds of data, usually qualitative in nature - metadata, documents, runbooks, applications, code, vector searches, RAG, and graphs. ""Context graph"" is a buzzword - it's just a graph database, the same ones we've had for 40+ years. The ""context"" just describes its purpose - a tool for providing context to AI models and agents.Offloading context, just like offloading data catalogs and other tools, help AI agents by preventing them from hallucinating, drifting, or getting context overload.Just like we don't expect an airline pilot to handle all measurement, observation, and emergency procedures themselves, we give them accurate dashboards, runbooks, and a support crew to help them achieve their tasks.Data engineering obviously has a role in both problems in terms of investing, transforming, and managing data into data warehouses and graph databases.",kthejoker,2026-01-19 19:19:42,9,dataengineering,t3_1qha2l9,False,
o0jzffa,"The meta for llms changes every week, so don't get two freaked out about it. Business context is usually captured with either RAG or graphs. RAG uses a vector similarity search algorithm to look up related information and graphs rely on nodes and edges to connect relationships in your data. Basically look at how Neo4j works. They have been talking about the graph approach for a while, but barriers are how your data is organized/tagged as it's less effective the fewer relationships you have. That's not easy to establish depending on what your metadata looks like. Also massive graph dbs tend to not be that performant. You can still get pretty good results with them, especially for document search use cases or something like that. But there are also people talking about how tensor based LLMs are limited and not going to get us to the promised land and the next step might be difusion models or something else. AWS also was talking about how they are maxing out what they can do with generic LLMs in training and how they could be more effective if they had access to actual business data to train on (not going to happen). Agentic systems are the current hot thing where you can create ""tools"" for the LLM to use based on the context. Like if a user asks an accounting question, the LLM can call an accounting agent that might have textual, RAG or graph resources to answer the call. It's interesting but also infuriating that there are so many approaches and the ""best"" approach changes almost weekly. It's still very early in AI development so I guess I would say don't freak out about learning one thing as it will likely change, but definitely do get into working with AI is future work will depending on it.

They just think 'but this is what everyone else is using so I should use it'.The annoying thing is, if you have good judgement and figure out the most appropriate tech to use, that can get in the way of upskilling if you settle on a simple, cheap but more mundane alternative.If you want to learn some of the things you listed:- if you're using snowflake, why not just start using dbt + git to manage your SQL?- how is data getting into snowflake in the first place?

You’re spot on about batch jobs quietly being the best fit for so many “real time” requests.On upskilling, experimenting with dbt + git is a great move even if it’s not in prod at your current job. Same with Airflow—just automating even one small pipeline can help you understand DAGs and scheduling. And if you want to broaden a bit into API stuff but aren’t getting those projects at work, there are plenty of open datasets out there you could ETL into Snowflake as a side project.

Your Python service pulls data from the carpark API and publishes events as they arrive. From there, you usually want some kind of streaming or messaging layer to decouple ingestion from processing, so bursts or failures don’t break everything. Next comes processing, where you clean the data, handle duplicates or late events, and compute whatever metrics you care about (occupancy, availability trends, etc.). This can be done in near-real-time or small micro-batches depending on complexity. The processed output then lands in a store that’s optimized for querying or visualization, which your frontend reads from. The key ideas to focus on early are idempotency, schema consistency, and what “real time” actually means for your use case (seconds vs minutes).

nzw1ach,"You’re absolutely right to be wary of random sampling—if you care about rare events, long tails, or uncommon categories, sampling can miss them entirely. Chunking with pandas is a solid approach for memory management, but you do have to be careful: some operations just don’t make sense chunk-by-chunk.Chunking is great for row-wise, stateless preprocessing (cleanup, type conversion, basic feature engineering). But for anything that needs a full view of the data—global normalization, deduplication, calculating rare category frequencies, finding global min/max—you’ll either need multiple passes or a clever accumulation/aggregation step.A typical workflow for your scenario:- First pass: Scan over chunks to gather global stats (means, stds, value counts, rare category thresholds).- Second pass: Use those stats to transform the data in chunks. Outlier detection, normalization, etc. can be done chunked, but with knowledge of global parameters.- Save intermediate files as Parquet if possible, for speed and compression.- Tools: Dask and Polars both handle these kinds of workflows better than vanilla pandas, especially Polars for very fast I/O and multi-threading.- For Colab: keep an eye on disk (mount Google Drive if needed), and be ready to restart if you hit session limits.If you ever need to empower less technical folks to safely interact with this data (without risking direct DB access), there are platforms nowadays that let you build internal apps over your datasets via drag-and-drop, or even AI chat interfaces.

At 30M rows, this almost always triggers an OOM (Out of Memory) crash in environments like Colab.​Serialization Overhead: Converting DuckDB’s internal format to Pandas and then to a model-ready format creates unnecessary CPU work and memory duplication.​Moving to Polars solved this because it feels like it was built for the 'Model' part of 'Data Science.' Since it uses the Apache Arrow memory format, it integrates seamlessly with XGBoost, LightGBM, and Scikit-Learn with zero-copy potential meaning the model can often read the data directly without doubling the RAM usage.​The Lazy API and Streaming mode let me handle the full 30M-row feature engineering pipeline with way more stability.

nzcw4l1,"I would have never done that like that. Sounds like you're a decent SWE doing DE stuff without formal DE & BI training.Python to gather API - 100% - but the way you do it, that data with that format at that time is lost forever.Python with API to a Datalake container, one folder per source, and subfolder per source API name. Store as JSON. Why? For SSoT and what if the supplier of that API goes out of business, changes their API in some way, that breaks your code? What if in your dataframe the tuple you extract as a table, you're not pulling all entites or all columns - then the business wants you to add those extra columns, retroactively from Day 1 you've been gathering. You're screwed - you don't have it anymore.So E-L-T. Extract (Python + API), Load (into storage for 100% retrieval of 100% of that data), Transform (into a Staging layer, dedupe, business rule(s) for ingestion UpSert or Rejection, into the Bronze layer.So Bronze has proper types and only valid data, Bronze can be destroyed (for a particular source) and recreated at any point in time in the future by rereading all the data in the Datalake and redoing the L & T of the ELT. Staging is usually truncate/load style, and uses Datalake functionality for ingestion - Python isn't needed here at all. Python only for reading from APIs and other distant sources, not for moving data around in the database.Python has another function - for ML - where Python does extensive transformations by reading Bronze & Silver (or even the raw Datalake data) to ""invent"" new data that is then fed back into a Staging layer.

Once the contract is up, SAP disables your company account, and boom, APIs no longer work, that SAP data that the company created is gone forever.Or, the cloud supplier doesn't use a version # in their API https url name, and they change the JSON structure enough to break existing code.When the L of ELT is done within the database layer with staging, this is an easy fix, and the Python gathering part, the E of ELT, continues to work as-is.In most cases, the SELECT statement reading the JSON data through the Datalake and putting the result of that Select statement into a staging table will continue to work, as you never ever do SELECT \* FROM (external table), will instead specify which columns.So fixing the SELECT into the JSON can be done without stress / alarm, and you can easily go back in time to gather the new columns since the time they were available.So Python -> DL -> Staging (Snowflake + Snowpipe with Python as the language can be used here - event driven - or simple SQL) -> Business Rules -> Bronze or Reject.You add audit columns and hashing as required in the Staging table to facilitate the UpSert logic.

Start narrow, Constrain what users can ask for (time ranges, metrics, dimensions) before going fully “chatty”. On the knowledge side, most teams I’ve seen keep it simple, Use RAG for business logic, definitions, metric semantics,Treat schema and relationships as structured input, not embeddings.GraphRAG helps when relationships are complex, but it adds a lot of operational overhead.Solr *can* work for retrieval, but it’s usually better as a search layer than a true graph store.

If you can transfer internally, that would be better.Understand your ETL/ELT pipelines like how data moves from point A to B (from source system up to the analytics layer) in your company. Learn how & why certain tools are being used in the system, their trade-offs in terms of scalability, costs, reliability, their impact, etc. Software engineering plus systems analysis & design concepts help a lot like SDLC & Agile methodologies for example.If you're proficient with SQL and be able to explain different situations such as knowing when to use subquery vs CTE, view vs materialized view, handling duplicate records, optimizing queries etc. then you're more or less good to go. Knowledge of Python/PySpark helps a lot as well.

I have also been involved with several data warehouse builds in my career. You are thinking about it in the right way as this stuff is always a series of tradeoffs. What does feature X do for us, how long will it take and what value does it provide?It seems like you are vague on requirements, which is the norm, so I would focus on that as it will inform what you build (i.e. you will be rebuilding and reloading if you miss a bunch of stuff). Start with what you have today and come up with a list of columns and the concepts they related to as a starting point. I would also get with whoever does the budget modeling / FP&A work for the company as they know the KPIs and drivers of the business, which you will have to align to. At the end you should have a list of columns or metrics with a domain and column (e.g. domain is customer and columns for account number, name, address, etc).Then start with that as you talk to other stakeholders. A good meeting might involve say someone from marketing who knows the views they want to see, a data analyst who might know what columns/calculations are involved in producing that view and then you and your DA can bump that off against your model. It's easier to ask them for what's missing rather than come to them with a blank sheet of paper. Also get a sign off from the department because they will inevitably come back with 20 more requests on the week you drop the finished product. The DA should be able to work from that artifact.The data model is important because ideally you want one data source that feeds 80% or more of your data requests. This ensures that data is consistent across all reporting and dashboards as it uses the same core data and calculations. If there is an error in a calculation, you can change it in one place and it propagates across all the dependencies. If you build custom data models for each dashboard or request, then you can have inconsistencies where the developer used the wrong formula, or when you need to make a change you have to find it and change it dozens to hundreds of times.In terms of important things I would say requirements is first (though you can often do this incrementally), then figuring out your infrastructure. Like what is your approach to building pipelines and does it provide velocity to develop, is it maintainable, observable, etc. Does your data platform align well with the likely use cases you know about? You sort of need this initial planning in place to get going, but afterward you can build incrementally as MVPs or by data subject to show off progress.You need to balance delivering value and insight to the business with the necessary things to support a robust platform. Things like automations should be considered, but it's a question of prioritization. How much time does the automation save vs time to build right now? Can we defer it without major consequences? Which ones are the priority? Can we produce demoable work each sprint or quarter to show progress, and better if the platform can be partially used to deliver value ahead of being fully fleshed out.\-sorry for the essay.",Gators1992,2026-01-17 16:44:12,1,dataengineering,t3_1qe02ol,False,

nzxfxhz,"The ""first load"" is just seeding the entire target resource with all the tables you selected. The consumption is a one time cost, right? That cost should be separated, since it is a different discussion than the rest of the CDC discussion, unless you design a solution that needs to be re-initialized regularly. Eg. I think Fabric's ""mirroring"" involves re-seeding every time the capacity is stopped and restarted. The ""after that"" part of your answer is probably more interesting to OP. This is where the underlying CDC magic happens. Most databases implement CDC by feeding the database transaction log to the subscriber. This can be done asynchronously, at a lower priority than anything else that is happening. In other words, the normal clients and users of the database can be given priority, and the CDC work can take place whenever there are free resources. I wouldn't necessarily agree with the ""5-10%"" increase in server usage unless the server was very small. This overhead would be based on a number of factors. If you had a TB of data and 32 cores on your DBMS and only 100 CUD operations at the source a day, then the amount of transaction log activity would be neglible and the CDC workload would be virtually zero. All things being equal the CDC workload would increase as the transaction log becomes more busy.

nzf007g,"I want to emphasize a question some people keep asking: **what level are you working at?** Are you a jr? A senior? Since you've been working as a DE for a number of years and you're trying to over-employ (?!) I'll assume somewhere at the mid-level. I'll note that I've primarily worked at startups so mid-level in my mind may have higher requirements or expectations than mid-level at MNCs.At the mid level or senior level, I'd expect a DE to get assigned a few tickets at the beginning of a sprint and, during standup, note that they're looking for a new ticket if they're done with their existing work. I'd also expect them to keep us abreast of any developments in their work so it doesn't fall behind, etc.For ad hoc requests, if there does not exist a triage system (for example: if no one picks this up in 15 minutes, it's fair game for anyone and respond to the request) then I would recommend suggesting one. If the style is ""whoever sees it first"" (like my job right now) then either the DEs must adapt to that style or communicate with one-another to enforce another style (like triage and sprint protectors or something); to ignore ad hoc requests or to require others to triage is putting extra work on the team --- and it seems like you've already been talked to about it, so it's possible that the team doesn't love that you don't pick up ad hoc stuff. The big word here is _communication_, and it's extremely important to have team-wide communication open.""Oh, but my job is so hard, and it's impossible to do XYZ...!"" Yes, I know, there are a hundred thousand excuses for why any of us don't like our jobs and why it's impossible and why the workload is intolerable. The reality of the situation is that you either adapt or fail to thrive.---As I finished this, I saw this comment:> I had mentioned how things worked with me in the past and I thing it is really simple and clear if engineering lead or manager just informs me if they want to pick any issues up.

E.g w.r.t manager I straight away told him if he wants anything done then assign jira OR atleast ping me the requirements so that I can create the JIRA and work. So set it up straight. If my manager was like be more proactive and assign yourself work then I would have probably done that. Find a middle ground that works both for your style and your manager style.

A lot of people who get bored in senior analyst roles feel that same shift, less enjoyment from “telling the story” and more from building the systems and models that make everything work. If you enjoy data modeling, Python, and building tools that reduce friction for others, that’s already a big piece of modern DE work. Many DE roles today are less about pure infra and more about enabling analytics at scale, which fits your background well. You’re not starting from zero, you’re just moving closer to the plumbing. On the ITIL / process side yes, it’s more structured, and that can be frustrating at first. The upside is fewer fire drills and clearer ownership the downside is slower change and more ceremony. People coming from “fast and loose” teams usually struggle with pace more than the work itself, but most adapt once they see the stability benefits. As for frustrations, you’ve already named most of them unclear requirements, data quality issues, tribal knowledge, and legacy decisions you inherit.

o08ykmb,Man I feel your pain. The situation you described sounds eerily similar to what I walked into at my current job a couple of years back. We had this sprawling CRM system that had been customized over the years by like 5 different consultants none of whom seemed to talk to each other. Marketing was using one set of IDs for customers sales had another and finance was just throwing their hands up in the air. Trying to get a single reliable customer view was a nightmare. We spent weeks just trying to map out the different entities and how they related to each other. It felt like unraveling a giant knotted ball of yarn. And then of course once we thought we had it figured out someone would drop a bomb like Oh yeah that table We stopped using that three years ago but nobody told anyone. The worst part was the constant requests for data pulls. Sales would want a list of customers with X Y and Z marketing needed a segment with A B and C and the data team was stuck writing custom SQL queries all day long. It was completely unsustainable and we never got to work on anything strategic. What finally saved us was this virtual data platform we implemented. The thing that impressed us most was its ability to automatically discover all these hidden relationships between entities that would have taken us weeks to untangle manually. The AI engine identified and resolved data quality issues too duplicate entries mismatched data types the whole nine yards. We didnt have to move or duplicate any data either which was a huge plus for security and compliance. Then once the data was unified we started building no-code ETL processes to push cleansed data to the different systems and to our data warehouse. That part really freed up our data team. Instead of constantly fulfilling ad-hoc requests we could focus on building actual data products and analytics. Seriously the reduction in headaches alone was worth the cost. I know it sounds like Im selling you something here and I kinda am. The company that makes the platform has a referral program and yeah Id get a kickback if you ended up using them.

Parallelism and code cleanliness is given no thought. You can write all shit code with single letter variable names mutating shit everywhere, and it will accept your solution more likely than a very clean functional solution, that is trivially parallelizable and would scale (if ever needed).Looking at LC mastery mostly selects for people, who have ground that stuff hard and memorized that stuff (which won't be of too much use on the job for actual real world problems) or people, who think that this kind of procedural mutating way of programming and the typically associated languages are the end all be all, and have limited experience with other things.I much prefer advent of code (AoC) style puzzles, where you can use any language you want, and you just need a number as the solution.I feel like solving AoC puzzles has improved my ability to solve problems the functional way, even, if they at first seem to not lend themselves well to the functional paradigm.

nzie2v8,"I can't really relate. I started programming at age nine with BASIC and never stopped. I'm 48 now. The work has become more enjoyable over time - not because of obsession, but because I've gotten better at it and avoided stagnation.The key has been continuous variation. Initially, I learned the essentials: variables, conditionals, loops, and basic control flow. When BASIC felt too restrictive, I moved to Pascal and C++, which introduced new challenges like pointers and object-oriented programming. After a brief period with Perl (which I didn't enjoy), I transitioned into web development with PHP and JavaScript. JS proved interesting because of its prototype-based inheritance model - a completely different approach from classical OOP.The pattern isn't obsession - it's sustained engagement through novelty. Each language shift brought fresh problems to solve and different paradigms to master. I didn't chase the same dopamine hit of early discovery; instead, I built deeper expertise while regularly introducing new complexity. The ""addiction"" you remember might have been beginner's excitement from rapid skill acquisition. That specific feeling doesn't return, but it's replaced by something more durable: the satisfaction of solving increasingly sophisticated problems with accumulated knowledge.

Everyone feels this way at one time or another, even those who doesn't appear so.2. Also, instead of giving in, to feelings of being an imposter, actively identify and address the weaknesses you've already identified, and do something about them.3. E.g. Note down terms you don't understand and learn/clarify them for yourself. Ask here. Or research on the internet. Or start a conversation with Claude or ChatGPT and say ""I am a programmer and I ran across the concept/term of 'dependency injection' \[for example\] the other day. I don't know what this is. Write me a short treatise on this subject including references so I can get up to speed. Include examples and exercises."" (for example.)4. You also observed you do nothing outside of work. Well, that's a hint/tell: Start doing something outside of work then! (""Doctor it hurts when I do \*this\*"" Doctor: ""Well stop doing it then!."" You get my drift.)5.

Bugs only become easy to detect and fix when* the programmer is somewhat good at debugging and familiar with the codebase,* the code has been written in a way that facilitates easy debugging,* the infrastructure has been set up in a way that facilitates easy debugging,* the programmer has tools available that facilitate debugging.People can have different preferences for how to go about achieving these things, but they're likely to involve stuff like* [Good error messages](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/error/index.html#common-message-styles)* Observability setups (logging, metrics, tracing)* Access to actual debuggers* Tests (both unit tests and integration tests)* Automated builds and common integration & testing infrastructure (to eliminate the ""it works on my machine"" situations)* Linters / rule engines that prevent certain code from being merged* Static typing and a [reliable type system](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) (there are some people who swear by dynamic typing, but Typescript is gaining ground over Javascript, and it's pretty common now to have type hints and typechecking for Python too, and apparently PHP)* Various code architecting styles, though preferences there _really_ vary, but see e.g. ""make illegal states unrepresentable"" and ""parse, don't validate""I.e. a lot of the work we do is done to make debugging easier, and avoid bugs reaching production in the first place.But depending on situation and the technology involved some bugs can still be pretty hard to figure out.

What I really lacked was some sort of project to put all that together and the knowledge to break that down into the necessary steps. After all sorts of tutorials on YouTube and Udemy that didn't really have any good projects to walk through, I found a great tutorial from Tim Corey that built an actual app. It was an app that you would use to track a 3v3 basketball tournament for your office. What clicked the most about his approach was going through the planning phase of what the application needed to do. It needs to register players, register teams, and assign players to teams. It needs to keep track of who paid the $10 entry fee for the current tournament, it needs to track the bracket and match ups for the current tournament, etc. The code was done in such a way that it would be platform agnostic, meaning you could build it as a desktop app that saved the data to both a text file and a database or it could run as a web app on your phone and connect to a cloud database or something like that. That's the kind of tutorial I needed, and it sounds like you need more hands on learning with the planning part. I knew the syntax for all the loops, how to create functions and call them later, etc., but I never knew how to sit down with a blank project in the text editor and start building something. That tutorial did a great job showing how to go from an idea of what you want to make to breaking that idea up into smaller steps. It also did a good job of identifying what you needed for the MVP (minimally viable product--the bare minimum features to be a functioning app) vs what were ""nice to haves"" that could be added in future phases.

See [Locality of Behaviour](https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/)> how to keep things readable without over-engineeringYou need to set the encapsulation boundaries the right way. If your compile time hierarchy of encapsulation matches the domain model, you will have a hard time managing all the different interactions and variations. An example for that would be an inheritance hierarchy where each class implements its own behaviour (Vehicle -> Car -> Truck / Bus; Vehicle -> Train -> ...; Vehicle -> Bycicle -> ElektroBike; Vehicle -> ??? -> MotorBike; ...)Instead, start with separating your data from your logic and keep your data in simple arrays. E.g. a List of Orders, a List of Products, a List of Deliveries, A List of Customer Account. This can be an exact match to how you design your database btw.. Also, have only 1 ID across **all** types of Entities. This will allow you to combine the Components at Runtime easily.Then write functions (not methods) that operate on those lists. One function may check whether your are going to be out of stock for any product and create a new order for your supplier. Another function may go over the recent orders by your customers and create an aggregated report of what has been ordered and how much. And so on.Think about your logic as systems or laws of nature.

Going a bit further into potential optimizations you can also notice that if the point that's dropping out of the window (`op`) and the point that enters the window (`np`) are both larger or smaller than the current median, the median won't change and you can just replace `op` with `np` without resorting the list. Another observation is that if `op` and `np` are on different sides of the median, you don't actually have to resort everything to rebalance both sides because the balance can be easily restored by moving one element to the correct side:* `op` < median < `np`: move the smallest element to the right the median to the left of the median; this element is now also the largest element of the left. The new median lies between this element and the new smallest element on the right side.* `op` > median > `np`: Find the biggest element on the left side and move it to the right; it's now the smallest element on the right.By using those observations and moving from fully sorting the window to simply partitioning it you should be able to make updating it much cheaper because you no longer have to shift all elements between `op` and `np` to either the left of the right.",sidit77,2026-01-17 09:01:49,1,learnprogramming,t3_1qf3ex6,False,

nzs52tk,"I recently had a team member staffed with me whose background was pretty much all js. His code (in java) was very weird at first: lots of methods taking and returning Map. I eventually figured out that as a js developer, he was not familiar with strong typing or even class type definitions. Of course JS6 and TS in particular support those, but JS does a lot with anonymous functions and weakly typed, ad-hoc key value pair objects as a programming norm. Memory management is also completely under the hood and so the whole idea of a pointer or reference type was new as well.Where I'm going with this is, the basics translate, but I still maintain that C/C++ is great first language followed by an OO-first language like Java, Python, or C# because it makes you internalize these concepts and gets you ready to write scalable, non-browser code. I don't prefer JS as a first language because it's hard syntactically to keep track of exactly what each construct is and the patterns, while syntactically concise, can easily be confusing on those points.JS is great; learn something else too. At least get to a point where you understand the difference between a function that's a method, a class template, or an instance of a class, understand variable typing, and understand why you might want strongly typed code and by extension what the typescript project was going for and why it was widely adopted by large js code bases.",Far_Swordfish5729,2026-01-15 19:14:50,1,learnprogramming,t3_1qds0ip,False,

What follows is what I try to practice, but I'm sure others have had more experience...You can pass by reference, that typically indicates the callee doesn't own the object and must assume it exists whilst and only until the function returns (or if passed to a constructor, whilst the exists). It places restrictions on the object which can be used to ensure you don't do things you shouldn't with it, and can be used to refer to automatically allocated objects.You can pass a unique_ptr, the implication being that ownership is handed to the callee. Or const unique_ptr, meaning the callee can use and modify the object, but not move ownership to something else.You can pass by shared_ptr, ownership is shared and lifetime managed by the pointer. I rarely used these. There are also weak_ptrs but I've not yet had to use them.Sometimes it's perfectly valid to just pass a copy too.I try to avoid using raw pointers in c++ unless forced to, e.g. using a posix or third party C API, and if given one, I'll try and wrap them in a unique_ptr with custom deleter where and as soon as possible, so I don't forget to clean them up.

Start small with a dataset where you have pairs like (root, modern name) and ignore multi-step history at first. Once that works, you can add intermediate forms as extra training examples or as a multi-stage pipeline.The hardest part will be the dataset, not the model. Etymology data is messy and sparse, and “multiple steps through history” is basically asking for aligned sequences across languages and time.

o0fv71r,"TLDR: The reality is most starting out heavily lack basic DSA or basic language functionality like stacks, heaps, and virtual space. There are countless things to learn but overall I recommend advancing in DSA and don't feel rushed to know everything. Take your time deeply understanding the simple stuff. Ask questions where things are assumed and seem obvious. If you can really feel what's going on it will stick better. If you're going to Leetcode try to stay in a particular topic for a while and avoid spreading your learning too thin across many different challenges back to back.I was in and out of university for a while and in between completed Coding Dojo Full Stack Development (don't recommend), made a bunch of projects and eventually a successful app on iOS and Android. You might already know many of these topics but this is what I find useful.What I learned is that anything.js (edit I mean most .js solutions, not literally a project called anything.js lol) React, Angular, etc. these full stack web frameworks are constantly changing and new trendy APIs are always coming. Many new APIs are made when someone has some slight problem with the existing options. The right way to use them imo is to know the good general fundamentals like CRUD, validations, DB servers and back end controllers for them, MVC structures, dynamic pages and templates and when you come across some new API you must use that's the only time to get into the specifics and spend time on it - when you need to.Leetcode is good with the right mindset. You can spend too much time on topics that don't improve your skills that much or focusing on the difficulty more than what you're actually learning. Every programmer should strive to be solid in DSA. Focus on things like arrays, binary trees, string modification and linked lists. Take your time to know the little things well. Ask AI for small learning project ideas and when you don't know something syntax or language specific don't ask AI but check the documentation because there you will be surprised at when else you come across or multiple examples of using a function. Try to solve the Skyline problem. The skill level rating shouldn't get in the way of what you want to learn. If knowing how to solve that problem advances you then just take your time on it and try to have solid knowledge in the small steps. If you learn how every little part of a single problem takes all day when you could've done a bunch of random ones to feel more comfortable in the language, it's fine because the former will stick with you.Maybe do a simple learning project in hash maps, or make a multi multi level index database with JSON files and JS and see how you can optimize it. Take a JSON file with test data and make a function that splits it to 3 files where the first is an index, and the next two is part A and B. See how you can modify the function to take number of files/splits and how to split them. For learning I try to keep my attention in the same realm for a while so don't jump around too much or do a project that spreads your attention thin.Those skills will follow you everywhere you go but a new JS API probably won't help you with much else.Know the topics that are needed but programmers starting out struggle with or are frequently missed either by curriculum or not needing it in a specific language:\- What is a stack and heap?\- What is a virtualized address?\- Asymmetric vs symmetric encryption, passkey generation, basic structure of encrypting and decrypting data and how to ensure you're doing it safely.\- When to use structured SQL data or NoSQL. What are the pros and cons? You can use both in an app so what do you want strict and what should be flexible?\- Allocation for data types.Relating to networking I don't know what fundamental work is needed I haven't dealt with that much yet, but less low level topics are solutions that reduce data redundancy, but also latency which can fight redundancy, and the size of transfers all while keeping security which can also fight latency for users. We are producing and sharing data in a rapidly growing rate as the corporate world wants everything cloud based and as AI does what it do. Any little changes to make an app function just as fast and secure but with less data being transferred or stored is very valuable. AI companies will be considering things like Azure Cosmos DB or something equivalent/better.

o0cdsbq,"Your `move_cursor` function is wrong. `\033[%d;%d` by itself doesn't mean anything.

For what you're doing, choose the count by comparing N to zero.* The variable names are unhelpful. What is N? By convention it looks like the array size, but it only means that at the start of the loop. It's actually the number of items remaining to be visited. And what is A? It's not the address of an array A, it's the address of an element of that array.* The empty initialization of the for loop means you're expressly designing this code to leave artifacts available for the rest of the block. Sometimes that's useful, but not here. Those artifacts are A, pointing just past the last element of the array, and N, which will by definition be zero.

nzef9au,"One project I've always wanted to take on just for fun is delay-line storage. Back in the day, machines didn't have RAM. You had fast access and slow access memory.One example was drum memory. At the most basic, there is a [write][erase][read] head over a spinning magnetic drum track. You had to wait for your data to sweep under the read head to get it - however long that took. This was a destructive process, because then the head passed under a magnet. This data was either written a moment later at the read head, or a write was scheduled to intercede the passive loop.They then put a smaller, faster access loop over just a few degrees of the track, and had a larger, slower loop for the rest of the track, and this would take a couple sets of heads to pull off.But this tech got faster still, and this is the one you can mimic - they used coils of wire, and sent modulated signals down it. Again with the feedback loop - if you wanted a piece of data, you had to wait for it to come around. If you wanted to persist that data, you had to immediately write it back on the wire. If you wanted to change it, you had to intercede the passive loop. You could add more storage with a longer wire, you could get lower latency with a shorter wire.So that's what you can do - send data to an echo server, one on the furthest computer on the opposite, most remote destination to you on Earth or as ambitious as the DSN, and the data is stored ostensibly in the transmission itself. Want some data? You'll have to wait for that data to get back to you. Want to persist it? You'll have to send it back out. Want to change it? You get your chance as it's coming back to you and it's time to send again.Call it a time sequence data cache.---If that doesn't quite fit the bill, then google ""fountain codes"", and implement your own bit-torrent-like protocol.",mredding,2026-01-13 18:59:52,3,learnprogramming,t3_1qbuqvi,False,

o07sapx,"In addition to what others have said, you need to realize that coding as a ""class"" and hobby by the nature of how it works forces every new concept and lesson to be cumulative even if your school isnt testing you that wayWhat I mean, is that during week one you learn variables and data types and have a test on those. Week 2 you may learn how functions work and be you'll be tested on functions AND variables and data types even if its not on the test because you'll be writing functions with variables in them. So when Week 20 rolls around, you are expected to have a baseline of everything that came before it because those concepts are used to do other things. It may sound stressful, but if you're struggling with new information and not knowing how to start, then like a lot of beginners you likely lack that foundation of skills. Its easy to learn something new, but if youre also only kinda comfortable with the concepts youve learned so far, you arent learning just a new thing. Youre learning a new thing AND still learning the concepts your class has moved past. You likely need practice, repetition is how experienced programmers can type code out quickly. When I need a loop, I dont think about the syntax at all, Ive just typed out a million of them incorrectly and it's muscle memory. So for me, if Im being taught something that assumes I need a loop, I wont be spending any mental energy on the syntax of a loop or any other concept, my entire brain is focused on the new concept. Coding is hard for new programmers, but if you feel you're getting overwhelmed, id implore you to consider looking backwards and not forwards, because you may not be hitting a wall due to the new concepts being tough, but rather because you're attempting to learn the new concepts while the old concepts are still being mastered. And if you feel thats the case, build things, use those things and repeat them over and over again until they're muscle memory. You're a CS student, so it probably irks you when you see people typing with their pointer finger. But if you think back, you probably were annoyed learning to properly touch type and keep your hands in the correct position. But now you dont even think twice about typing, your brain thinks of a word and your hands do the motion required.

When I brought up (nicely) some of these points and wrote them with my human brain and human thoughts (as he requested me to do), he replied with some generic GPT answer. It was clear it was GPT because I copied my comment into GPT with the prompt: ""Write a response to this"" and it spit out some of the exact same sentences and bizarre words. So yes, AI has affected my job in the sense that now I am a slop reviewer, and it is showing me who the braindead people are who rely on slop generators to get their work done.

My exec has some self awareness, and know what they have built proves a concept but should not go near production.Ignore most of the advice here: do NOT go to the exec and tell them how bad what they have built is. It is true, but that's not the point. They have to learn this, they cannot be told this. They have contempt for software developers and the craft of software development. Ignore the glazing; if you tell them what they have built is a turd they will show their contempt of you. These guys are in full Dunning Kruger world now, and they have proven to their satisfaction that software development is fast and easy.They now trust AI over human experts. This is something you have to go with and accept; but you can influence it. Try to influence them towards getting an LLM to review the system they have built. Help them with some prompts; I'd suggest getting ratings across a whole load of dimensions, with a score out of 10, an exec summary, and then a final overarching recommendation. Stuff like ""You are an expert software architect with 10 years of software architecture experience backed by 10 years as a software developer building large systems. Critically review this application for adherence to best practice architectural and computer science principles...."" blah blah. Assess on SOLID, DRY, coupling, thread safe, self healing, HA, type safety etc. Then do the same for security. Then maintainability. Ask it to describe what what the software does, and how well that aligns with the specification document (which I expect does not exist, or is a couple of sentences). Etc. etc.. Get their beloved AI, which built the system, tell them how diabolical it is. You cannot tell them this. They have to learn it themselves, and they trust what AI tells them.If that success, then craft a prompt to get it to agree with what likely you want to get to. For example: You want an output along the lines of ""this application proves a concept; that the functional requirements can be met. But this is not fit for production and is irrecoverable. It needs to be started again, by software engineers, who can guide the AI on tech stack, architecture, security, maintainability etc etc"". Get agreement to build a team which will largely vibe code, but will be composed of experts. Maybe then point them to resources which illustrate how AI is a software developer tool, not a replacement.

Don't commit to only one path.Here's a lot of assumptions I have which underpin my thinking:The exec does not have career experience of actually building software. There is no CTO / VP of Development with solid Engineering skills, or they are not respected within the exec and have little sway. The exec has a long history of asking why software takes so long to build, makes unreasonable demands, does not provide clear vision and tangible objectives.

Some intern managers are great, some are just mediocre, but this is unusually bad.That said, this is an opportunity to make the best out of a bad situation, so here's my advice:First, do the work you're assigned, no matter how stupid or boring it sounds. Finish copying the data to Excel, email it to your manager and ask for more.If you get more, do it as professionally as you possibly can, even if it seems boring and stupid. Part of the experience of working at a company is that sometimes you have to do boring, stupid work. Doing it well is necessary for success.However, for the rest of your time, you should have two goals:1. Make yourself useful2. Learn as much as you canYou're in an amazing position right now. You have access to a whole company full of professionals, and almost no responsibilities.This is a fantastic opportunity, if you want to take advantage of it.Who cares what department you're in? Start meeting people in different departments. Tell them you're an intern on the Data Analytics team but you're not very busy and you'd like to help.It won't be hard to find someone who has some work for you.I don't recommend keeping it a secret! Tell your manager you did all of your Excel work, and that you met someone in another department who gave you a task. I highly doubt your manager will care.And of course, your goal is to learn something. Find people who are actually good at their jobs (unlike your manager) and are interested in teaching you how they do them.Having your manager give you a good review at the end of your internship is nice, but it isn't the only good outcome. Any other employee who ends up impressed with you at the end of the internship could end up being a great resource. When you apply to future jobs and give a reference, you don't have to give your manager - give some other senior employee who liked you.

Take a look at the comments, you’re gonna see some people saying it’s unusual… And then some people saying it’s normal.At the end of the day, I feel like it’s 50-50, and beyond that the real question is… What are you gonna do about it?If you don’t feel like you have work… The answer is the same. Ask somebody to give you something to do. But here’s the thing… The best thing you could possibly do is make the best of the opportunity you have. As long as you do that, you’ll leave on positive terms and be able to ask for letters of recommendation in the future. That’s your end goal.So here are some ideas… Ask someone what is the most important codebase for you to investigate? What are some fundamental principles that you can look up, if you’re interested doing that person’s job? What is a problem that the company currently has that could provide value for the company if it was solved?Be sure to let people know that they can answer this in a very high-level, simple way if they don’t have a lot of time. Let them know that you’re not trying to interfere with their daily work… But more so, you’re trying to find some things to dig into and research independently. After a while if you’re at a good internship position, they’re going to give you some more useful work… but if you’re at a bad place, this is going to be all you get. Either way, though, if you take this approach, everyone will know that you tried, and you would have documented evidence that you asked C questions and got Y answers. Document everything (your questions, the answers, and the research/work you did), and write up report from your internship. Save it somewhere. Memorize a 30 second breakdown of what you did. If you do this, it won’t matter if you have three bad internships. You will seem more prepared, and experienced, than 90% of all candidates for other jobs. The real skill to legitimately learn and to genuinely get jobs is to:1. Do your best, genuinely.2. Document what you did, at every place on your résumé.3. Create a logical and truthful story about what you learned..4. Always learn, at every position, even if you’re learning about what not to do (pay special attention to proactively investigating how you can provide value… and managing yourself in a way that provides value to the company).You can do all of this systematically no matter what anyone else does. You don’t have to be a genius, and you don’t have to become a rockstar. All you have to do is to provide documentation that you work hard and are willing to reasonably spend your paid time, focusing on providing value for the people that pay you (if at all possible).The worst thing you should say about the company is, “Even though I had very little guidance, I was able to spend company time improving documentation [something you were told was important] and learning about [something you proactively researched]”You should always be looking for how this internship can provide value for you. If someone helps you provide value for the company, great! But if no one is giving you work to do, make sure you get what you need from that opportunity. This could impact how much money you make (10k-20k+ a year)… or it could impact if you get a good entry-level position.I purposely did not respond in a way that had anything to do with, how to make the company act differently. Because this is something you cannot control… You should focus on how you can behave in a way that would set you up for success no matter how the company behaves.

My second internship, I did absolutely nothing. I showed up to the office, had a desk, no work. I just asked the engineer for a schematic of their network and system infra, and essentially memorized it. I’d bring questions as to what this does and why.

I see people telling you tot need to apply to 1000-1500 jobs. That’s not quite accurate. There’s some randomness to it all. The more you apply, the more you have a chance for finding something that aligns with you. But it’s not a guarantee, and some people luck out and find something sooner. - People are really bad with perspective. There’s nothing wrong with what you wrote about yourself, but there’s an issue of scale and perspective. How do you compare to all the other people currently looking? There’s no way to answer that, but it can be hard to stand out from the crowd. There will be a lot of people with similar backgrounds, better backgrounds, and worse backgrounds. You can’t control much except making yourself a better candidate and trying to give yourself as many opportunities as possible. Anyway, you have to just understand that rejection is a part of life, and it’s a part of the job search process. That’s easier said than done. Regarding false certainty, that’s just part of life. There is just a lot of uncertainty in life. If you’re a sports fan, there’s uncertainty in the outcome of a game. There’s what likely will happen, but no guarantee. Some don’t watch because of anxiety. Others watch and let the result really impact them, and others watch and move on with their lives.

What you need is visible proof you can ship, like a real app or something, so that website idea could be cool, if you actually do it.

o066b6a,"I can try to give my two cents here since I am at just under 2 YOE (1 year 11 months). “Mostly frontend work; very comfortable here” — I would say that I am fairly confident in my front end work as well. When it comes to Front End work items on our board in DevOps, I am usually the one that gets handed these types of tickets since front end work is pretty much straightforward and self explanatory. “Self-sufficient, don’t need handholding” — I’ve noticed probably within the past 4 months that for this portion I am starting to be more self sufficient, but occasionally I do need support or guidance getting through the work item. For instance, I had to edit a table (database migration for C#) on one of our database tables for an application that we are in the midst of building and kind of got lost. I had to nudge one of our lead developers for some assistance, but I still occasionally do need help with more difficult problems that I sometimes run into. “Can own features end-to-end” — for this specific point, this is NOT true with me. If you really do own features end to end I expect these to be more front end feature work items, but not back end stuff. I struggle with back end work items immensely. Correct me if I am wrong please!!!“Collaborate with other teams on system design and write ADRs” — At my company, we really don’t have “ADRs”. Sure we understand the things we work on, but my company is so small that having things like this does not really benefit us. For bigger companies I could definitely see the benefit of this. My coworker who has been doing Software Engineering for 15 years wrote up the architecture design documents and database schema for a new application we are releasing soon about 6 months ago. He knew EXACTLY how to get it done, how long it would take, and how hard it would be. That’s something I totally expect from someone with that much experience. It also depends heavily on the work place you are at. Especially what you work on, how difficult it is, and if you are learning new things. I would say that from what you said in your post and comparing where I am at, we are probably in a similar spot. Now I don’t know how much you make, but I expect the next job you get (hopefully for me too) you will make substantially more. What I would work on for improving your knowledge is maybe look at more back end specific problems. I am currently working on a full stack application that calls a local database and uses REST to grab information from said database. I had a coworker who moved on to bigger and better things that told me back end development is where the big money is at.

Know who to go to ask to get information to handle some ambiguity, know when to ask team lead / senior when it's getting too big.Jr Devs seem more rare, but being able to help them or pair program and learn together to at least do the easy tickets.At least be able to take a stab at a small to medium problem and make some kind of drawing. Maybe use LLM to help and then make sure you understand what you made. Senior dev probably still modified or rejects solution.DevOps specifically just depends where you work. I found I need to know how CI/CD works and some basic to touching intermediate topics about AWS / K8 for interviews. I have only gotten the opportunity to write unit tests and update yaml files and deploy docker containers, so I can't speak there. I had dedicated DevOps teams at my other jobs.So my opinion (that may not be that accurate) is learn as you go and get your work done in a timely manner. If you have time afterwards review the work and make sure you get it.When you get to interviews though, different ball park. They want you to know (in my experience):the ability to system design large projects, solve medium LC's in 10-15 mins or a custom coding challenge, random trivia of basic to intermediate topics about your coding languages, varying levels of DevOps questions, SQL questions including asking specific syntax or make a query right now verbally or type in chat, strong behavioral stories that show impact and good team dynamics / easy to work with.. Then I got my job offer finally, and I'm potentially being bait and switched to doing lowcode despite needing to be some on paper super coder to get the job :face_with_tears_of_joy:",Super-Blackberry19,2026-01-18 16:17:21,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1qf6xt2,False,

You should think of college as your part time job and what you do outside of it as your main job to really bolster your chances to get a job once you graduate.If it sounds like a lot it's because it is, but it's a lot easier than being unemployed for 2+ years after graduating which is what's starting to become standard. So don't be a standard graduate. It's not the 70's anymore where having a degree guaranteed a job, hasn't been that way for a long time and is only getting tougher.",NICEMENTALHEALTHPAL,2026-01-19 18:10:08,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1qh8kg3,False,

o0f46op,"Part of my job is mentoring the Team and Tech leads that report to me. A couple of them are 15+ years my senior, and just ended up ""stuck"" at that level. Both of these guys are very smart, great developers, and good mentors to the Junior and Senior engineers on their teams. Their problem is the same thing I've seen skilled developers fall prey to over and over again throughout my career: lack of understanding of the business impact of their job.You likely have seen this as you've done Product Owner/Manager roles, so you're already ahead of the game. At the end of the day, though, lots of developers don't want to think about what they are doing in the context of the business, either because they just want to focus on the how and not the why, or because they are afraid of dealing with something that isn't as clean and clear-cut as solving a technical problem. Both of these Leads at my company have these sentiments, despite them understanding that they need to do more.The thing that helped me advance in my career and make sure never to stagnate, was to develop the business skills that helped me understand just how my work as a developer directly impacted the business. It helped me understand what to focus on, how to prioritize work that got the most impact internally and externally, and how to communicate critical needs to business stakeholders, especially in the form of long term support in favor of building tons of shiny new features as fast as possible.Those skills have proven to be transferable in a way that mastery of a specific language or framework simply haven't. I was stuck as a JavaScript dev for the first 8 years of my career, despite moving into a Team Lead role, because I wasn't focusing on the business problems as a whole and instead acted as the tool used to implement a solution someone else came up with. It was in this role that I started to be exposed to the larger discussions around what we were building, and why, which helped me realize that if I added my own voice to the conversation, I could influence what was happening and be seen as much more valuable than a simple code monkey.This helped me pivot to other languages and frameworks, including hopping from entirely Node/Vue.js as my stack to .NET/React with no real experience in either. I could understand the business reasons for why decisions were being made, which convinced my soon to be boss to hire me and take the chance that I could get up to speed on their stack in a reasonable amount of time.Now that I am in management, I use those skills constantly, but I still actively try to code in my spare time. For this, AI has been immensely helpful! I use Claude Code daily, whether its for doing the bulk of the super basic coding that I'd probably have done with snippets anyways while I handle the complex business logic, or having it explain the codebases I have access to but don't work in and still need to help make technical decisions for. I basically treat Claude as a pocket engineer who never needs to sleep, gets way too eager and excited and sometimes needs to be reigned in, but is still clever and helpful. I've used it to help me build fully custom applications specific to my company, Claude API cloud agents that help my engineers debug their work completely autonomously, and basically just manage my day to day work life.All of this is to say that you can still work on the things you are good at, enjoy doing, and still be a coveted asset companies would fight to have. Embrace AI as a way to level up the skills you already have and fill in the gaps you're missing. If you use it as a crutch while you're learning the strategic thinking required to lead a technology company, even if you have no desire to be a CTO/CEO, you'll be able to navigate this new AI powered world while still doing what you love. You don't have to go into management to influence the direction of a company either. Prove your ability to think tactically and with an understanding of the business' goals, and you'll have no problems finding a job well into the future.",ShockinglyApparent,2026-01-19 04:11:18,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1qggf3o,False,

o0jrw58,"The best way is really taking an interest in the discussions around what you and your team are building. This is obviously easier if you are part of an organization with a product team, but there are always stakeholders in every project. Instead of sitting back and being assigned work, ask why that decision was made. Play the junior card and your desire to learn, you'd be surprised just how many people get excited to explain why they have made a decision. Ask to shadow the discussion with stakeholders, then debrief with the other members of your team. Its important to remember that this is going to be extra work outside of your normal responsibilities, so you still need to get all of your work done or else you can lose peoples' trust. But the skill of learning from people more experienced and rapidly absorbing new knowledge is critical to succeeding long term as a software developer.Also, use AI as a coach. Even if you aren't allowed to use AI at work, you can still generally get away with telling it roughly the feature/functionality/application you and your team are building, the context of your company, and relevant tech stacks, then have it explain what it thinks are the likely business decisions. Then take that to the people involved in deciding the work that's been done and explain ""your thoughts"" and see how they line up. If you are allowed to use AI at work, instead of using it as a fancy auto-complete try to use it as a pair programming coach and have it explain why decisions and patterns may have been used. All this needs to be done with a healthy understanding that the AI very likely could be wrong, but at least it gives you a jumping off point to go confirm with somene who knows.",ShockinglyApparent,2026-01-19 21:16:09,2,cscareerquestions,t1_o0fws64,False,
o0k0mlp,"The most organic way is to insert yourself into discussions involving decisions made with stakeholders. At a more senior level, you should have the knowledge and skills to be able to look at an abstract problem and implement a robust solution. The key here is that often times engineers with those skills still act like more junior devs, simply taking orders and doing things how they are always done at the company. This is where you can approach these discussions from your side. Instead of simply taking orders, insert yourself into stakeholder discussions and talk through what they are looking for and give options on how to build what they want. You'll have to come prepared with the ability to explain what you want to implement at a level that less/non-technical people can understand. But if you keep showing up with good solutions on how to implement what people want, and can deliver on that implementation, you'll start to get invited to more and more of these discussions. Also, use AI to brainstorm and propose new design patterns for features. There's always the caveat that AI can very likely be wrong, but its a good jumping off point. Since you're new to it, just treat it like a conversation with another developer. Tell the agent when its wrong or has made a mistake and constantly give it new context. Ask it how you can improve the information you're giving it to help it come up with better answers. I am constantly getting better at working with AI agents, because I just throw problems at it and see what works. It seems kind of silly to think of it as a skill, but you really do get better working with them simply by putting in the time. I pay for the $100/month Claude Max plan and find it incredibly worth it, because I can have an idea and blitz my way through a rough implementation and decide if its worth pursuing, while also getting better at working with the agent, all in my personal time. At work, I am lucky enough to have the budget to spend a fairly sizable amount of money on Claude API tokens, primarily because I have proven the value of it to my boss, but I wouldn't have gotten there if I hadn't been experimenting on fun personal projects like my homelab server, custom websites and webapps for little hobby projects, and a healthy chunk of home automation.As far as resources go, one of the best books I was introduced to by a college professor of mine is called The Lean Startup by Eric Ries. It may be about building a startup, but the skills are extremely transferable to existing companies. Every single business needs to spend resources efficiently to survive, and understanding where you can deliver value the most is key to success. Also, I very recently discovered Lenny's Newsletter, which is a site with an enormous amount of content around Product development, Engineering, and how leaders in the AI space use AI to run their businesses and professional lives. I've just started digging into it, but its been really eye opening on how I have just been scratching the surface of using AI, and I already have several fully custom AI tools in use that I build explicitly to help me manage my teams at work.",ShockinglyApparent,2026-01-19 21:59:33,1,cscareerquestions,t1_o0hw77i,False,
