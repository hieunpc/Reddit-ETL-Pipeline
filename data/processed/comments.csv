Since people are going to suspect LLMs anyway, I used one to try to reorganize it.I would probably add some testing too.---# Data Engineering Pipeline Checklist## 1. Requirements First- **SLA**: How fresh? (minutes/hours/daily) Daily reporting → no streaming needed- **Impact**: Cost of being late/wrong?- **Consumer**: Dashboards, ML, reporting?## 2. Architecture**Single source of truth**: One storage layer (warehouse/lakehouse/object storage). Everything reads from it.**Batch over streaming**: Streaming adds complexity (ordering, retries, idempotency, late events, backfills). Default to batch unless real-time is essential.**Design for backfills**: Parameterized date ranges, versioned transforms, separate raw/modeled layers.## 3. Reliability**Idempotency**: Jobs must be safely rerunnable via partitioned outputs, overwrite-by-partition/merge strategies, deterministic keys.**Orchestration**: Use Airflow/Dagster/Prefect for retries, dependencies, visibility, parameterized runs. Avoid ""cron spaghetti.""## 4. Observability**Minimum to prevent silent failures**:- Row counts/volume checks- Freshness checks- Schema drift alerts- Job duration tracking## 5. Performance**Optimize last**. Most slowness comes from bad joins, file layout, or moving too much data—not lack of Spark.**Fix basics first**: Partitioning, columnar formats, filter pushdown, avoid cartesian joins.## 6. Simplicity Rule**If your SLA is met with**: scheduler + Python/SQL + storage + basic checks**Then distributed systems add unnecessary complexity.****Use distributed systems when**:- Volume exceeds single-machine capacity (hundreds GB–TBs)- True real-time requirements (sub-minute)- Complex streaming aggregations- Multiple concurrent consumers need isolation",sib_n,2025-12-19 01:49:33,10,dataengineering,t3_1ppuky6,False,

Something lighter like Liftbridge (Kafka semantics, single Go binary, no JVM/ZooKeeper) or just NATS JetStream covers 90% of cases.On the storage side - totally agree on ""one source of truth, columnar, object storage."" We're building Arc with exactly this mindset: DuckDB for compute, Parquet for storage, S3-compatible backend.

nuwaj7a,"Hey, I can understand. About six months ago, I joined a US-based organization as a Founding Data Engineer, and initially I felt really good about the role. For the first three months or so, while building the team, everything was smooth. But after that, I started feeling more or less the same way you described. When you’re the decision-maker, from system design to the nitty-gritty details, you’re also the one who gets blamed when things don’t work out. At one point, I even felt that juniors were contributing more than me because I was stuck in a loop of wrong decisions. But that’s okay. We are engineers, and we are supposed to try, fail, and learn until something works out. It can feel overwhelming to be your own north star at the beginning. I hope you start figuring things out soon. During my own period of doubt, my CTO once told me, “I’m happy that you’re demotivated. It shows you’re serious about your work, and when things don’t work out, you feel disappointed. That’s a great engineer trait.” So you do have a great engineer trait.

Use draw.io or something like that to draw your architecture, and share that with your team before building it and review it to see if it is foolproof. Then go build your application to that architecture. Things will fall into place, and you’ll have a documented trail of why you made decisions. And for streaming itself, just use Spark structured streaming. And if you need to do a backfill have a classic Spark job set up for it.

nuwz6xk,"I've read your thoughts across this thread and have something for you to consider:Engineers sometimes focus too narrowly on technical capabilities and not on the bigger picture. The job is to solve problems and achieve real-world objectives. Sometimes to do that we have to consider other constraints on the problem space, such as:- ""this technology is inferior, but it's battle tested and has loads of technical support staff backing it; we can't afford the risk of a new system going down and having no way to fix it""- ""this technology is old, and therefore I can easily hire people who already know it, and there is a lot of documentation; the new one is great on paper but we need experienced staff to maintain it, and they are hard to find""- ""this new technology is better than what we currently have in terms of technical performance, but we've rigged up enough custom ameliorations around the existing core tech that we will realise hardly any real world gains from switching""- ""we would benefit from switching technologies in a measurable way, saving £50,000 per year, but it would take this entire team six months of work to move all our legacy code onto it. They have other, more pressing priorities and the benefit doesn't outweigh the cost of hiring a team of contractors to do it.""But let's say you think there's a big pool of potential adopters for whom SQLMesh II would make business sense. It's not so easy to take a slightly superior technology and turn that into a going concern. dbt has mass adoption.Are you personally planning to fork SQLMesh and spend a substantial chunk of your time maintaining it, if Fivetran strip the original for parts? Perhaps you will fund this via a hosted version - will you be picking up the phone to pitch it to companies yourself, or will you use your own money to pay someone to do that?What will you do if Fivetran freak out as soon as you get traction and throw a bunch of engineers at making dbt good enough to kill your competitive advantage? Unlike SQLMesh-original-flavour, you don't have proprietary code; Fivetran have access to the same stuff plus a lot more resources.Remember, you _only_ get acquired if it makes business sense to them to spend the money on buying you out ... instead of on using their own engineering team to outcompete you.

Note that through the majority of the history of data warehouses the principal platforms were general purpose databases like db2, oracle and sql server. In fact there's very few features in say snowflake that you can't find in the general purpose databases.A few considerations: * It all depends on your total data volume, the data volume your queries will be scanning, the number of queries, etc, etc, etc. * But a 10-20 TB data warehouse using Postgres can work absolutely fine. * Partitioning is critical * Summary/aggregate tables may be critical if you want really fast queries for dashboards, etc. I like to monitor my use of these like one would monitor buffer space / caches for transactional databases - and try to get 95+% of my queries to hit them. * Certain queries will benefit from the use of indexes. This can provide a significant edge to performance. * Configuring your database to support query parallelism is also critical at volume. * Database constraints are just as important in OLAP as they are in OLTP - and postgres can provide a ton of value here! You may need to turn them off on massive fact tables, but you can also use them at least with summary & dimension tables. * AWS RDS has pretty slow IO, but other hosting options can provide blisteringly-fast servers. But you may need to have postgres dba skills. * All the above assumes vanilla postgres. Adding extensions for duckdb, columnar storage (hydra), etc can provide faster performance in many cases.FYI: I migrated part of my snowflake reporting to postgres on RDS a few years ago in order to save a bunch of money.

nu46kmh,"I mean there isn’t really all that much to learn, it’s just one type of model definition on dbt. I think this medium article describes it pretty well: [https://mbvyn.medium.com/understanding-dbt-incremental-materialization-c32318364241](https://mbvyn.medium.com/understanding-dbt-incremental-materialization-c32318364241)Incr models load existing tables with more data using various loading strategies. The article explains these well. Key concept here is loading only what you need to, making it useful in situations where the amount of data is very large and/or compute is a concern.A key thing to understand would be is\_icremental(), which is a function which will return True if the model it is being applied in *already exists* in the warehouse (and is also an incremental model which is not running in full-refresh)That means anything wrapped within is\_incremental() won’t be applied the first time you run a model, or when you fully refresh it.This is what you use to compare existing records in your target with your source so you only load the new and/or updated records, depending on your strategy.You can also flip that and use NOT is\_incremental(), meaning that what you wrap it around will only run the first time the model is built (or on full refreshes). That could for example be if you have some old stale data that you need to union with on the first run, but then never need to look at again, except for the case of a full refresh.EDIT: For some clarity, heres an example of an incremental model from dbt docs.If this model has never been run before, or needs to be fully refreshed (reloaded) then `{% if is_incremental() %}` will evaluate to false, meaning that the SQL it wraps wont be sent to the warehouse. That makes sense, since `{{ this }}` will be rendered as the incremental models name. Hard to do a select from something that doesnt exist yet right? We need to compare event\_time in source with what we have loaded before, which we cant do if we've never loaded it.Once we've loaded data for the first time, the if statement will evaluate to true, meaning the WHERE clause gets put into effect. Then the models SQL will return results using that filtering, and that's what ends up getting inserted into the target table in your DWH. {{ config( materialized='incremental' ) }} select *, my_slow_function(my_column) from {{ ref('app_data_events') }} {% if is_incremental() %} -- this filter will only be applied on an incremental run -- (uses >= to include records whose timestamp occurred since the last run of this model) -- (If event_time is NULL or the table is truncated, the condition will always be true and load all records) where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from {{ this }} ) {% endif %}",vickelajnen,2025-12-15 06:32:11,6,dataengineering,t3_1pmwjju,False,

nu67tkw,"There’s actually a few things to be concerned with. One issue is making sure you are dealing with the proper timestamp. A lot of the examples in this space gloss over this aspect. For high water mark incremental processing you want to drive off of the timestamp representing the moment the record was written in your data warehouse/lakehouse/dbt. You do not want to rely on the application timestamp or the timestamp generated by your source system for incremental processing. For the purposes of this conversation, let’s assume `table_a` and `table_b` both represent this in a column named `dbt_updated_ts`.Another concern is persisting these timestamps in your target model. You will need to decide on `table_a.dbt_updated_ts` as `table_a_dbt_updated_ts` and `table_b.dbt_updated_ts` as `table_b_dbt_updated_ts` or doing something like `least(table_a.dbt_updated_ts, table_b.dbt_updated_ts) as source_dbt_updated_ts`. Regardless of the decision, you should *also* re-state a `dbt_updated_ts` for downstream consumers of your model. They should *not* look at your various source timestamps for incremental processing, only your new `dbt_updated_ts`And this is where the rub comes in. Now you have 2 sources with 2 different timestamps and you need to process them incrementally. A comprehensive way of doing this would be to take all the keys above the high water mark in source a and union with the keys above the high water mark in source b, union the keys together, then use that to scan both tables again to make sure you catch all the changes. Generally this is computationally expensive, although it should give the correct answer.If you are doing this to create something like a SCD type-2 dimension it gets more complicated on top of this, as you will now need to deal with the temporal aspects of your source system as well.I would warn you of this: if someone says add a lookback window, that is usually to cover some architectural sin. This should be questioned.It’s complicated and often computationally expensive to process multiple upstreams in an incremental fashion. Do not forget the maintenance cost: next month you will have an engineer who thinks they are clever and will mess with this logic and it may be ok for most cases but not certain edge cases. KISS. If you can, just materialize any model with multiple upstreams as `table` and save yourself the headache. Again, single-model HWM incremental is perfectly fine, it’s when you attempt to incremental more than one model at once where you will find pain.",raginjason,2025-12-15 15:50:18,6,dataengineering,t1_nu62qv9,False,
nu5lr9u,"You'll want to establish a single \`event\_time\` field (like the person mentioned that responded to you above) that you can use to check if a row needs to be updated by your incremental model.So if you're unioning multiple tables: SELECT id, action_date AS event_time FROM table_a UNION ALL SELECT id, event_at AS event_time FROM table_b UNION ALL SELECT id, timestamp AS event_time FROM table_cand then use `event_time` as your condition in your WHERE clause",creamycolslaw,2025-12-15 13:52:49,3,dataengineering,t1_nu5e134,False,
nu5hnle,"Depends on what you mean.If you're joining/unioning/selecting from other up stream incremental models, you don't really need to think about how they are materialized. At least I can't think of a scenario where you would need to consider that. I could also be completely wrong here, not something I've really given any thought.If you mean in the context of joins/unions within the same model, you still only really have to think about where and when you apply the is\_incremental() macro. To use the above example again (but expanded a bit), say we have some old stale data that we need to load, e.g. from some old source system, and then we're adding data from the new system on top. We still keep the same fields and everything.In this example, the first time we run the model, the first incremental macro will return false, because the model deosnt exist in our target dwh yet. The second macro will return true, since the target table doesnt exist yet. So then we will run the main query, and then union in the old data.On every subsequent run, the first macro will return true, and the second one false. So on all future runs, we will be filtering data from the new system, and disregarding the old one entirely, since no new data is being generated there.So we wrap SQL we want to compile and send to the warehouse depending on the context in which the model is running. In practice I've only used this to wrap a WHERE (most common), CTE's or UNIONs. You can also include multiple wrapped statements as below, for example we might apply an incremental macro inside our CTE's in order to make the model more performant. I find it hard to imagine a scenario where you would wrap it around a join. {{     config(         materialized='incremental'     ) }} select     customer_id,     period,     total_sales from {{ ref('app_data_events_from_new_system') }} {% if is_incremental() %}     where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from {{ this }} ) {% endif %} {% if not is_incremental() %}     union     select         customer_id,         period,         total_sales     from  {{ ref('app_data_events_from_old_system') }} {% endif %}This means that the compiled SQL will look like one of these 2 (excluding all of the DML that dbt builds in order to actually insert the data into the target table): -- FIRST RUN RESULTS IN select     customer_id,     period,     total_sales from new_db.new_schema.app_data_events_from_new_system     union     select         customer_id,         period,         total_sales     from  old_db.old_schema.app_data_events_from_old_system -- SUBSEQUENT RUNS RESULT IN select     customer_id,     period,     total_sales from new_db.new_schema.app_data_events_from_new_system where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from target_db.target_schema.target_table_with_app_data_from_both_source_systems)",vickelajnen,2025-12-15 13:28:30,1,dataengineering,t1_nu5e134,False,
nug07et,"Last paragraph imo is the big one. I have hardly met any coworkers that understand the problems that come with incrementals involving multiple tables. This means all of the incrementals they've built involving multiple tables are impossible to reproduce from scratch because those incremental tables are not being updated correctly. Had an entire database in a previous company where they would have to regularly refresh all of the datasets because of this and it would sometimes crash in the process. Absolute mess.For me, because I have the skillsets to do so, I pretty much prefer to stay away from any sort of incremental involving multiple tables and use table materializations like you mention unless I 1) really need it and 2) can implement it in a more generic way rather than a custom incremental model. More generic being something like a custom materialization or macro. For example, we have an incremental materialization that checks counts of the source query vs the incremental table by the incremental timestamp to load deltas. This makes the actual SQL in the DBT model involve no incremental logic and makes the DBT model robust to source data that sometimes updates some historical data instead of only inserting new data. If this scenario had been implemented as a basic DBT append-only incremental model (which it was before it got refactored), then the data would not match reporting from the source system.The example I gave speaks to another problem that goes beyond what you bring up (engineer that thinks they're being smart). There's also the problem that often times engineers will develop something with some assumption for how it's going to work in their mind. ""Oh, well we should only get new data for this process every day."" This is only sometimes true. I've worked at multiple companies and every company has had at least a couple of processes you might expect to work that way but don't for business or engineering reasons. For example, if you have a DBT model that involves updates from multiple tables, what happens if table A is updated later than table B? Then on the next run, you may have to update your incremental on late-arriving data from table A + historical data from table B, which leads to historical updates in your table. Of course, there's other ways to implement these things, but by no means trivial in my experience.",simplybeautifulart,2025-12-17 02:28:31,2,dataengineering,t1_nu67tkw,False,

nuba45t,"This ended up being longer than I expected. Hopefully you find this useful. There's actually a lot to your question.When it comes to designing a mart, I keep the ""analyst"" persona in mind as much as possible. This is my north star, even if I don't have analysts. Querying a star should be simple, not something full of odd case logic, analytic queries, coalesces, and the deep SQL knowledge. Save that for your transformations leading up to the star if needed.Regarding keys specifically, there are several goals I have when designing a mart. From the perspective of the ""analyst"" persona querynig the star:1. Joins (dims to facts) should be done with `INNER JOIN` not `OUTER JOIN` - this is for performance and for usability2. No records should be dropped via join - this is a quality issue, you should not be dropping revenue on the floor because your users dimension is incomplete or late for example3. Join conditions should be singular (e.g. no `AND` in join clause) in nature - this is again for performance and usabilityThe ideal query would look something like this: SELECT SUM(f.revenue) AS revenue, d.customer_name FROM fct_sales AS f INNER JOIN dim_customer AS d ON f.customer_sk = d.customer_sk GROUP BY d.customer_nameThese goals need to be addressed in concert. To do so, you really need a lookup process instead of a hashing strategy.In order to address 1 and 2, you really need to have placeholder records in your dimension for ""unknown"", ""missing"" or ""not applicable"" customers, and your fact table creation needs to use these values as appropriate. You cannot hash your way out of this problem; you need to process your dimension (or at least your dimension lookup) first, and then process your facts. Generally this is done with a lookup table. For item 3 in isolation of 1 and 2, if your dimension is SCD type-1 from a single system then using the source system natural key seems reasonable. Once you have multiple source systems (say, customers from 2 systems) then the natural progression is to either add a `source_system` column and make sure everyone remembers to join on that as well (hint: they won't) or to concatenate your source system with the natural key. This concatenation leaves you with a string key instead of an integer key which now negatively impacts query performance.If your dimension is SCD type-2, it's worse. You are left with something looking like this, which is not obvious to analysts, performs poorly, and is error prone: SELECT SUM(f.revenue) AS revenue, d.customer_name FROM fct_sales AS f INNER JOIN dim_customer AS d ON f.customer_nk = d.customer_nk AND f.transaction_ts BETWEEN d.begin_effective_ts AND d.end_effective_ts GROUP BY d.customer_name Usability note: Is it `BETWEEN` or did you do the right thing and make your `end_effective_ts` the same moment as the next `begin_effective_ts`? I can almost guarantee your analysts will either use `BETWEEN` or worse they won't consider the effective dates at all and `DISTINCT` the result set to get what they want. Honestly, it's doubtful that future engineers will remember which way you went with effective dates either. All the more reason to address this in your transformation while building the mart instead of leaving it to the mart consumers to remember.To achieve goal 3 with SCD type-2, you want to put a SK on the fact that represents the state of the dimension at a point in time (probably the moment of transaction). To do this you will also need a lookup, as you cannot hash your way out of this either.At this point it should be clear that lookups are the way to go. So the real question is why would you want a hash instead of an integer? To me, the answer is now obvious: integers take next to zero compute to calculate, will join more efficiently, have half a chance at clustering in a meaningful way, and are immune to collision.TL;DR integer lookups",raginjason,2025-12-16 10:42:58,2,dataengineering,t3_1pnjmno,False,

nuiqn48,"u/Advanced-Average-514 \- Totally fair take and I agree with the core tradeoff you’re pointing at.A couple clarifications on our intent though:1. We’re not trying to recreate a human analyst doing open-ended exploration (yet). We’re aiming for safe, repeatable workflows first.. the stuff that’s painful today because it’s frequent + operational (support, RevOps, CSM, finance ops), not really deep research or exploration. 2. Dashboards are great when questions are known and stable. Agents get interesting when the question is variable but still bounded, e.g. “why did churn risk spike for these 20 accounts?”, “summarize anomalies by segment”, “draft an escalation note with the relevant context,” etc. The way we're thinking is that these sandboxed, curated views/tools are guardrails - the agent still does the synthesis + narrative + next-step suggestions.3. We’re also treating schema exploration as a separate (higher risk) capability. I agree that to do real analyst work, you probably need: semantic layer + table relationships + multi-turn exploration. But letting an LLM roam your warehouse is also where we foresee getting: cost blowups, accidental joins into sensitive tables, hallucination and more. One more reason we’re starting constrained: **repeatability.** For some of the agent tasks we're aiming for, it’s almost mandatory for teams to yield the same answer for the same/similar questions (or at least the same underlying definition/query) every time. So our plan for now is: **start constrained → earn trust → expand surface area (curated views + sandboxing allows us to do that)** ideally with a semantic layer + policy checks as the expansion path.

What I've experimented more with is snowflake's 'cortex' ecosystem which allows you to do RBAC on curated views with semantic layers.

nuvmtdt,"tl;dr: I wouldnt necessarily advice to use Snowflake as operational database. As an analytical database, it might help you if the analysts are experiencing timeouts and/or slow queries Depends on how much data you have. Are analysts experiencing problems when they run queries on MySQL? And if they are, are you sure this is a problem related to the amount of data or could it be due to a bad-indexed db or small ec2 instance used to query?By design, Snowflake is not made to be an operational database. There is a new table format called Interactive Table, which according to the documentation is basically the way you would use Snowflake for transactional data (low-latency + high concurrency). It is, however, also written that you get best performance by querying that table with a Interactive Warehouse, which - and here's the catch - is by default ON all the time (which will sky-rocket your costs)If the analysts are experiencing slow queries, then replicating databases in Snowflake will definitely (most likely) help. In this case, I would leave the MySQL database as your operational database and replicate them in Snowflake, where analysts would only query from there (given that they are ok with some delay in the data compared to the data in MySQL). You'll spend a bit less with the AWS instances used to query data, but I'm pretty sure your Snowflake bill will more than compensate that decrease.Btw, I move data from MySQL to Snowflake doing exactly that: lambda -> s3 -> Snowflake (using Tasks) + PowerBI. Very quick to get it up and running (with a first load done with DMS), but given that lambda is not really made for this kind of task (there's a 15min hard timeout in the lambda), I'm on the process of moving that into fargate.",maxbranor,2025-12-19 15:44:03,1,dataengineering,t3_1pqncik,False,

nuipac3,"All excellent questions.1. Cost and speed - I’m in the process of running benchmarks against progressively larger databases. So far, I’m seeing a maximum 10% overhead in storage for the VCS on the database. Cost is dependent on your architecture, but if we’re going with Aurora RDS, it’s dependent on IOPS. This solution uses Copy-on-Write, so there is an increase in IOPS over just running against production, but less than simply copying all the data. Since it’s also delta-based, the IOPS are only upserts, but those are ran twice (once on the branch, once on the merge into main).2. Difference with Git - generally, you don’t store data in Git outside of small test sets. This is a branch that essentially allows you to run your code in production without ever actually touching production. You connect to the same database, so you don’t need to modify your connection (beyond minor branch variables with can be set via environment). Subsetting your data can result in edge case failures since a subset by definition doesn’t include every case. 3. Blame - you can track blame for every record, every column and row, every constraint just by querying rather than digging into the CDC or building a proper SCD pipeline. 4. Silver bullet solution - that right there is the reason behind this post. I want genuine feedback from the community. I have worked at several jobs where this would be incredibly useful, but that’s only my limited experience. I know there are other, more targeted solutions for the various problems. I wanted to get a sense of others’ experiences to see if this addresses a genuine broad need, or if it’s overkill for the majority of problems. One issue I’ve faced constantly is the introduction of bad data into the production database via improperly structured code which might look fine in git but fails in weird ways when applied to the entire database. This allows you to not just review a PR of the code, but also a PR of the data changes at the same time.",cmcclu5,2025-12-17 14:49:23,1,dataengineering,t1_nuhbbj5,True,
nukczua,"Interesting, I do a lot of work with dev teams around logging, what I’ve found works for us is being clear on the exact code change, logic and format of it. We even help write test cases for them in some cases. We also have dev data flow into our data lake so we can validate and iterate dev data before production so it doesn’t break or mess anything up.This has taken a while to get into strong place for a lot of teams such as buy in from stakeholders, value output and context around what the code does so we can advise on the change, especially around the logger and implementation.For the case of having it tied to git sounds interesting, but we are large org, hundreds of repos and already well defined process for releasing code changes (not necessarily tied to data) so to add have the data change linked to PR would be difficult I think for us to introduce as the there’s a lot of teams, infrastructure and processing for us to validate. Ways we have gone to improve the feedback loop is to get the data show back to people as possible. So getting dev data back, tools to view logs as interactions happen and pushing to be advisors/partners on the logging side. Also running QA checks and validation on dev data to catch drift early has been a massive help to catch things. This is generally through strict types like struct types in spark or pydantic etcThis generally means data engineers try to partner with teams for a log change and setting guidelines and docs on best practices to follow for teams to be self serve. Once a change is implemented, DEs integrate and transform data for other downstream teams and analysts to consume.Definitely not a perfect solution, but has worked well for us. Starting over tomorrow, would I consider a data vcs? Maybe as a trial to experiment but probably not. Data is generally later phase concern when building a product/service unless the data is your product, but usually not the case.Having had to built a service for users and already a key stakeholder of the logging implementation, time spent on data logging was tough to prioritize as needed something built and out the door and made more sense to do after release as a follow up.Having typed structure really has been the biggest help.

They help to simplify the design of asynchronous systems where you send a lot of time waiting on network traffic, disk reads, or user input. Async does not run anything in parallel, and you will not see any performance improvements from in; in fact, overuse of async methods in tight loops can significantly harm performance due to the added overhead of the event queue.Part of why async design is popular in Python and JavaScript is because threads really suck in those languages. The existence of the global interpreter lock in Python <3.14 severely limits how well threads can perform, and worker threads are a huge pain to manage in JavaScript.

nuay6y4,"So, let me tell ye about the old timey times.What we used to do is load pages in serial. Request came in, and as we processed the page, we'd make database requests, wait for the response, build more page, do more requests, etc. Not great. If you had a long loading page, it might takes 20 seconds or more to load.So we got async. Async was cool because now when a request comes in, I serve you a template and give you some URLs in my API to query. Each makes its own specific action and on completion does something else. Page loads in 0.5s, most of your data is there in <1s, and that one long 15-second query stalling out the old page eventually loads in when ready. Great!However, we ended up with edge cases. Your page loads a complex tab that needs data from 5 dynamic drop-downs that it also has to load data for. That's 5 requests that all get triggering in serial using async or .thens (aka callback hell), or you could hope for the best and occasionally end up with a race condition and a failed load.So we got promises. Honestly, for >90% of use cases, it just improved handling with then, catch, finally, etc. But it also enabled us to use Promise.all where we could cleanly write code, where we could call some nonsense like: function foo() { Promise.all([ getUserDropdownData(), getCityDropdownData(), getStateDropdownData(), getDepartmentDropdownData(), getSomeOtherData() ]) .then(values => { //doesn't execute until all of the above data is loaded const [userData, cityData, statedata, deptData, otherData] = values; buildUserDataDropdown(userData); buildCityDataDropdown(cityData); buildStateDataDropdown(stateData); buildDeptDataDropdown(deptData); buildOtherDataDropdown(otherData); }) .then(() => { //doesn't execute until we're done building all the dropdowns refreshTableData(); //...might have to add a 1ms timeout to grab default values accurately }) } /* disclaimer, I half tested this real quick with timeouts, may or may not work, example only */You would literally be tearing your eyes out to do that without promises; I'm talking 3-4x that many lines of code to sync all of it up. Also, with overhead, you might be waiting \~200ms for each request, so your drop-downs load in \~220ms instead of \~1000ms. Now we can cleanly make those requests in parallel without fear of race conditions, and request our table data even faster.We also got web workers; because Javascript is single-threaded it just executes whatever is at the top of the stack. If I have to do something that counts to...1 billion, that'll block the top of the stack while it counts, locking the rest of the page. If I assign it to a worker, the worker gets a separate thread from my main JS thread to do its task.And that's all I'm gonna say because I took way too long typing this.",Mike312,2025-12-16 08:45:09,8,learnprogramming,t3_1pnuj7k,False,
nub0kfo,"> Is multithreading considered “legacy” or risky now?Depends on the use case. Async doesn't help with CPU-bound work. Multithreading can.> Are async/event-driven models actually better for most scalable backends?Async is just a way to have a suspendable function. For backend, the theory is that we spend a lot of time waiting for slow IO. OS-provided threads tend to be heavyweight (e.g. every thread reserves memory for its call stack, and that tends to be O(MB) for each thread). So using them just to wait for slow IO is wasteful. If we instead move all that into userspace, we can avoid a lot of that overhead.> Or is this more about developer experience than performance?It's both, although async/await also has some downsides (mainly [the function coloring problem](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/)). Some languages / runtimes (like Erlang, Go, and Java) manage to avoid the function coloring problem.> A lot of blogs and talks make it sound like classic multithreading (threads, locks, shared state) is something people are actively trying to avoidI maintain that async is susceptible to many of the same issues that multithreaded code is susceptible to, but at a more coarse-grained level. If you have shared data that is being operated on by two in-flight `async` calls, then they will interleave with each other in unpredictable ways. You still want tools to e.g. block one async function from resuming while a different async function is busy updating some shared data.Because async/await has well-defined preemption points, you're not going to have a single memory location that is being read from and written to at the same time. But you _could_ be in the middle of updating a complex structure. Perhaps it's in an inconsistent state, but you need to call an async function before you can put it back in a consistent state. That's basically the same problem that exists in classical threading, with the same solution - you want something like a mutex.There's a reason that Go and Java (with virtual threads) both have mutex types, despite both supporting colorless async. Even then, you are encouraged to use higher-level tools if you can. But sometimes, you just need a mutex.",balefrost,2025-12-16 09:09:24,7,learnprogramming,t3_1pnuj7k,False,

Everything else is a guessing game :slightly_smiling_face:P.S. Forgot to say, it's worth trying to assess the flow of data in your application.

nu5vonj,"SQL injection happens when you are able to identify that the receiving application does not sanitize the user input or limit permissions levels before passing it to the database (application is what authenticates to the database, not the end user). Take the following as an example loophole. The common SQL injection came from login pages, meaning the application would accept a username and password from the end user, then will check the database for matching records.An example of a poor and vulnerable way to handle the input / login process would be something like`Select TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = '{input.username}' AND Password = '{input.password}';`then accepting the record returned as the 'authenticated' user. Now, lets look at how the resulting query would work for a normal input as well as a malicious input. Lets say I put in ""John@Doe.com"" as the username and ""RubberDucky"" as the password. The application would pass the following to the database`SELECT TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = 'John@Doe.com' AND Password = 'RubberDucky'`fair enough, now what happens if i put in a username of ""Admin';--""? The application would pass the following `SELECT TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = 'Admin';-- ' AND Password = 'RubberDucky';`The database will return the first user that has the username of ""Admin"" and consider it to be authenticated because ' will finish my string input, "";"" would terminate the SQL command, and ""--"" comments out the rest to prevent any kind of syntax errors. that is just a very basic example. Another example i found in production (i work for this company and had permission) was they created an API that would allow you to pass in a SQL query to generate custom reports and such (HORRIBLE IDEA btw). To make it ""secure"" they used pattern matching and prevented commands like ""UPDATE"", ""DELETE"", ""\*"", etc. So as a proof of concept, i encoded my query in b64 and passed in a query that would decode and execute it to create tables, dump SQL user names, dump stored CC info, etc. I have also seen people do it in HEX Once you start spotting potential holes like this, the possibilities are endless as to what you can do. Here is how you might be able to get the server credentials from a SQL injection [https://medium.com/@markmotig/how-to-capture-mssql-credentials-with-xp-dirtree-smbserver-py-5c29d852f478](https://medium.com/@markmotig/how-to-capture-mssql-credentials-with-xp-dirtree-smbserver-py-5c29d852f478)",TheRealSlimCoder,2025-12-15 14:48:47,237,learnprogramming,t3_1pn8rvc,False,

nu5vklq,"Here is a very [simple example](https://xkcd.com/327/): Let's say I have a website where you type in your name and it gives you some stats or something.So, there is an edit box where the user types in a name. The front end then sends the name to the back end to retrieve the stats.Let's say the backend does an SQL query on the database like ""SELECT \* FROM Students WHERE Name = '$name'"".Normally this works great. But what if I type the following:Robert'; DROP TABLE Students;Now the SQL query on the backend looks like this:SELECT \* FROM Students WHERE Name = 'Robert'; DROP TABLE Students;When that is executed, it will search for Robert in the database, and then it will wipe all the data out.Of course you can do more advanced things other than deleting stuff in the database. You can add other queries to try to extract more information than the website would otherwise allow. You can probe the database for other tables, like maybe asking if there is a list of credit card numbers. You can get really fancy like querying to see if any columns start with the letter ""A"" or ""B"" or ""C"" and so on, and if you do enough of those queries you can reconstruct the schema for the database and discover all sorts of interesting things.I wrote a simple website one that had a shell injection vulnerability. It was a great way to learn, and I felt really dumb when someone pointed it out to me, but I'm super glad they did! Using a similar attack against my website, someone could have executed arbitrary shell script code on the backend as the www user.

This will make the sql query return true, so the login will succeed when it should fail.There are lots of other issues with this code, but that is how SQL injection can work.

If the backend also only uses interfaces to other system, then it's no an sql based attack. However, if the other system is vulnerable then maybe the injection happens there. And that's where the application has access to the database. It uses a pool of connections that will just execute any command you give it. You can make it so that certain commands are not allowed, like dropping tables, but modifying data and reading data your are not supposed to might still be possible. >how are they able to get data returned from a database with their query if they are not an authenticated user to the databaseThe application is authenticated. >and how would they even know what to inject into the SQL database to get what they wantThey often don't.

You really have to see how 90ies PHP websites were made to understand how insecure it all was. Note that it's only possible in very old libraries that let you just create strings containing sql queries that you then execute.

You can't just pass ""1' AND 1; --"" and have it be inserted into ""select \* from users where username = '%s' password = '%s'"". And we salt and has the passwords, if there even are any.

There's nothing wrong with asking AI to clarify and teach. That's exactly what a professor does; to accommodate curriculum reading.What I'll do when trying to pick a new project I'd like to do and ask it something like this: ""I'd like to make an app or program that does xyz. What stack would you recommend and why?"" It'll spit back a bunch of recommendations. Then I'll pull up Google and read a bit about them and pick one. Then I'll pop open the documentation and ask the AI: ""Let's start from the beginning. How do I render zyx? Or how do I get a basic function abc working?"" Then I might ask it to explain the code and reference the documentation. I'll sometimes ask it for a list of the most common functions from the API and what they do, etc... but once AI helps me get the ball rolling I gradually transition to doing things myself. Once I understand the code the AI generated I'll apply it myself. This approach can take awhile but has gotten pretty functional at learning new skills.

Some people have learned the ""single return"" style and stick with that.Others prefer the ""return early to handle error conditions"" style, which has its advantages.Most people seem to miss that the two styles are not mutually exclusive. It's certainly possible to handle errors early without an early return. Though, it usually means that we need to do one of two ""not nice"" things stylistically: (a) we need to increase indentation for the non-error case, or (b) we need to use a goto at the error point (or throw an exception), which many people find not nice, but rarely say the explicit reason for their aversion to it.In your particular example that you cited, the early return is not really an ""error case"", though, so in this particular example, placing both the returns at the same indentation level (i.e. one within in the ""if"" branch and the other within the ""else"" branch) would make the \*intent\* slightly clearer.Now, suppose you wanted to amend the function and include some kind of ""error condition"" like for the value 0 (which is mathematically neither even nor odd). In such a case like that, then in my opinion it would be clearer to use an early return for that, since doing so ""idiomatically"" expresses the idea that this kind of situation is an unexpected or unusual case. I.e., maybe the caller made some kind of mistake by asking whether 0 is even or odd, because logically that may make no sense, so maybe it's a mistake that it was asked.Once the ""error returns"" are taken care of, the rest of the code can basically assume (correctly) that the value in question is ""correct"" in terms of logicality. I.e. for this function it means the rest of the code can assume we are dealing with non-zero quantities, which almost always helps analyzing the correctness of the algorithm.",chaotic_thought,2025-12-17 08:08:00,20,learnprogramming,t3_1poqy8r,False,

What happens if an email address doesn't match the ""`isValidEmailAddress`"" check?It's a bit easier to read, both in terms of lowering mental strain and indenting depth, if you take simple cases and pull them out like this: // Try to guess the user's first name, return a generic name if it can't be inferred String guessFirstNameFromEmail(String emailAddress) { if (!isValidEmailAddress(emailAddress)) { return ""Alex""; } if (username == """") { return ""Sam""; } if (username.contains(""."")) { return username.split(""."")[0]; } if (hasUpperAndLowerLetterMix(username)) { return username.splitBy(SplitMethod.CapitalLetters)[0]; } return username; }In the lower case, it's more of a series of deductions - you're considering your assumptions first, and it reads more like getting ""weird"" cases out of the way first (bad input, empty string, etc...).",sessamekesh,2025-12-17 09:03:30,4,learnprogramming,t3_1poqy8r,False,

For that reason, we'll have one return at the end of the function, and use a temporary variable to store the return value. You don't need to have a crazy nested if-else structure for this. Just set the temporary return variable to some value (like null) when you create it. As soon as you hit a return situation, set the variable to some non-null value.

Sometimes they even make more objects.Then there are four ""pillars"": encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.1. Encapsulation is when an object's properties are hidden to the public, and optionally only exposed through some kind of filter. These are most commonly seen as `get` and `set` methods.2. Inheritance is when one type of object is a ""subclass"" of another (""superclass""), so every property and method of the latter also belongs to the former. 3. Abstraction is when you hide the internals of how something works, and just expose the inputs and outputs. This is far from exclusive to OOP; chances are you're already used to this. 4. Polymorphism is when you refer to the same object using different types to get different information from it. In the same ""subclass"" relationship used for inheritance, every object of type subclass is also of type superclass.That's it, that's OOP!

Hard to pass that up.I did NuCamp from September 2024 to March 2025. It's designed to be a part-time program that you can do while you have a full-time job, but I'm not sure how realistic that is. I quit my job and went all in when we started React. Before the BootCamp, I was in tutorial hell, having done Free Code Camp, Harvard CS50, Odin Project, YouTube, and Udemy classes. I'll say that even with all that prep, the BootCamp was a firehose of information, and by the end of it, I was exhausted. I liked the classes. Most of the teachers I had were good. The Jobs class they offered was total trash IMO, but that could have been because of the teacher, who felt more like a social media influencer. That class did force me to finish my portfolio website, so it wasn't all bad. Their Discord is actively shouting out jobs. I ended up taking a few more months after class to wrap my head around React and get better at JavaScript by building projects and doing CodeWars. Over a year after starting, I'm now studying Front End Dev questions I pulled from GreatFrontEnd and dabbling with LeetCode, which has been incredibly frustrating. At best, I've probably got another six months of practice and projects before I'd be hireable, but realistically, I'm thinking I've got another year. I'm an artist, so this stuff comes slowly to me. Since you're already doing analytics, I'm guessing it will be faster for you.If you do the BootCamp, my advice is to do personal projects with people in your cohort. That was probably the MOST beneficial part of the BootCamp. Looking at my group's code and trying to make everything work together really forced me to understand it and broke me out of tutorial hell.Another tip I'd give is to grab a BootCamp class off of Udemy when it's discounted and work your way through it to see how you do.

You just answered a real question: ""this file should not be publicly accessible""From there, the same thing keeps happening:* group by technical role: MVC-style architectures* group by feature/resource: modular architecturesHexagonal, clean architecture, MVC, etc. are not things you start with.

nuxg0eo,"tl;dr: if I need something extremely complex and nothing matches my specific use case, or I need something very simple that I feel like will take longer to find, import, and localize.A long time ago when I was working on an ERP system, we needed a way to display tables, needed something to take a data set and do obvious things, like show data in cells, sort, filter, and paginate. But we also had a ton of niche cases and requirements. Sometimes management wanted a summary of the table, and it may need to sum, average, or count the number of times a certain value (or range) appeared in a column.Some cells also needed to provide a link, multiple links, or color-code text in some way. Some cells needed to reformat data in a certain way - for example, if we got a timestamp, did we need to show just the date, just the time, seconds since time, etc. One manager always wanted us to separate date and time as two separate columns for Excel reasons. Oh, yeah, and it needed to have a one-click download CSV export of the data in-browser (so, it couldn't re-send the data to the server to generate a file).Wrote one, it worked great, used it for about 8+ years and it got copied to several of our different systems. Eventually one of the juniors asked why we were using my library, and not some npm library he found that did ""the same thing but better"". My answer, after looking at the library, was that I wrote mine 4 or so years before the npm library was created according to its github history. It also didn't support all of the features, or at least not in some of the specific use cases we had. So it *wasn't* something that existed when I needed it, and it also still didn't technically do everything we needed it to do.Similarly, I'll also ""engineer"" extremely simple things from scratch if I feel like it would take me longer to find a library to do the thing than it would to write. This case was we had a dashboard for a monitoring tool that just needed to show groups of ""top 10s"", so 10 rows, each containing a bar, another bar (with a definable color) inside of it with width based on a percentage, and a text value (that could also be a link).

Not from the comfort of your room, but in the office while you work for example. You won't pull headphones to watch any videos there. For now it looks like cs50 or a Udemy course would be a better fit for you. But in the end it doesn't matter much. After the tutorials is where the hard part begins and there are no videos there.

nut1pk4,"Just a bit of advice and perspective:First, you can access the videos from Free Code Camp's Concepts [here](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecampconcepts/videos) They have said they may be removed at any point in time, so look into a YT Downloader or some such. Their main YT channel also has several long video tutorials and crash-courses to my knowledge.There is also lots of videos all over YouTube about most programming topics / concepts, computer science, as well as specific tutorials on projects.Second, unfortunately, reading is just a part of programming as I am sure you're aware. You're going to have to read requirements of projects and their documentation, as well as write it. You're going to have to read code and genuinely try to understand it, both the functions and the larger whole. You're going to have to read documentation of the programming languages, tools, and APIs you're using.I'm not saying that to shame you, God knows, I barely read books. But reading is very much a part of programming, from the learning to the actual process of doing.Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp are both what I have experience with. They're both solid platforms, and I'd probably complete FCC first, and then circle back to Odin Project and see about the gaps and more advanced knowledge it covers. One of the big advantages is that it is fairly unguided and gives you a set of objectives to complete. This forces you to think about what you're doing, how and why, as well as forcing you to acquire knowledge and documentation just like you would on any real project.At that point, I'd probably just try making projects. Maybe dabble in a game engine like Godot because of its lightweight nature, GDScript which is very easy to read and write, and ability to do web exports for Itch.IO. Hell you can even use it to make applications / tools, not games, but I digress.I'm just not sure what to suggest that can fulfill that video requirement, besides trying a hybrid approach. Try to at least read the highlights and general idea of a topic, and then look for some videos about it, maybe practical examples. Don't force yourself to deathmarch paragraph after paragraph, but I don't know if you can truly avoid reading either.I'm sure others know more, I mostly learned by messing around modding games, reading books, nibbling on these tutorial sites and such.

They won't necessarily cover everything, but everything that they don't cover should be ""dealer's choice"", i.e. they shouldn't matter to the end user, if they do, then it should be in the AC.For your example:AC1: Make a GET endpoint /orders that returns a JSON response matching the schema ...

So...short answer, it is just part of learning. Do not feel fake or inferior. And, definitely, you learn by doing. Watching videos can be interesting, but they do not help me really learn.

I have b-degree in business administration, never worked in related role. 2 years ago I was 27, applied for a second university, 2 years course which teaches programming (qualification at the end). I already had bachelors degree, I didn't need 2nd one. Before the school I learned some coding already, so the course wasn't that hard and I had a bit of experience already. I only had experience with frontend, today I can build full-stack applications. (junior lvl) I got scholarship for being the best in class so that helped financially.2 years later. I'm still looking for job since June. Yes, I'm a bit picky of which role I want. I don't want to work as administrator in a bank and answer old grandmas calls. I want to do something programming related cause I know I have a knowledge and experience more than some juniors today. And I will be hard working and learn as fast as I can. But I had mby like 4 interviews in 6 months for the roles that I was not really happy about so let that sink in.What I think: Bootcamps in todays job market sucks. 5 years ago they were worth it, cause you could learn fundamentals in 4-5 months and company was happy to hire you and they would teach you on the job without any experience or knowledge. Because to be real, nobody can learn advanced things in 6 months. You will only learn some simple things. You won't learn to build advanced full stack applications with best practices and high security. And today company expects you to know all of that, which takes 8 hours a day for 5+ years of doing real job.I will be completely honest. If you are not a genius (so that goverment can hire you) or you don't have a relative or a very good friend who can hire you. You won't get a job. There are already 1k devs with so much more experience, knowledge and skills applying for the same role you want.

nupbj6f,"The core idea of OOP is to associate data with behaviour. E.g. instead of having a `sort()` function that sorts a list of data based on an algorithm, your data has it's own `sort()` method, so it kind of sorts itself instead of getting sorted.On first glance this sounds very powerful, because a list of strings may be sorted differently than a list of numbers or a list of pointers. What OOP allows you is to have a list of any type, just call `.sort()` on it and the correct sorting method will be used automagically.This idea was then further applied to other things like a Date. Instead of using a library of functions and a collection of structs that the functions work on, you now get an object and have all functions directly associated with that object, so instead of writing `dateutils.to_string(date: Date, ...)` you now have `Date.to_string(...)`. In the early days of OOP this was used for code reuse through inheritance. Inheritance just means, that you define a new class and tell the computer that this class should have all the features of that parent class plus the new stuff you define and except the stuff you redefine in the new class.However, it turned out that Inheritance doesn't work well for code reuse, so nobody sane recommends it any more for that. It also turned out that it's more common to have different behaviour than different kind of data, so people started using ""Composition"" instead. Composition just means that your objects has other objects that are used to perform different kind of behaviour. For Example, you may have a class `Animal` and the animal is supposed to have different behaviour like walk, run, speak, eat. Instead of using Inheritance to create new subclasses of `Animal` and implement different behaviour, you define small interfaces `IRunner`, `IWalker`, `ISpeaker`, `IEater` (or similar) and write small classes for each interface. There might be a `Bark` and a `Meow` class implementing ""ISpeaker` and there may be ""BipedRunner"" and ""QuadrupedRunner"" implementing ""IRunner"" and so on. You then create different animals using the Animal-Constructor:```pycat = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Meow(), CarnivoreEater())dog = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Bark(), CarnivoreEater())horse = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Whinny(), HerbivoreEater())cat.speak() # ""meow!""dog.speak() # ""wruff!""horse.speak() # ""neigh!""```This is what ""Composition over Inheritance"" refers to. So we're almost back to having functions applied to data, but instead we call a method of an object that then looks up another object and calls one of that object's methods (for each individual method call).A big downside of OOP is that contrary to its promise it makes code harder to maintain, because you create a compile time hierarchy that matches your domain model and with that you create boundaries around things (objects) instead of creating boundaries around properties (e.g. positions, prices, ... ).

You’ll learn more about Git hygiene, reviews, naming, and decision making there than from most blog posts.For API keys and secrets specifically, the rule is simple. Never commit them. Use environment variables, config files that are ignored by Git, and documented setup steps so another developer can run the project locally without guessing. Almost every production issue I see around secrets comes from shortcuts taken early.Books like “The Pragmatic Programmer” and “Clean Code” are useful, but treat them as guidelines, not law.

From my experience and talking to professionals degrees like cybersecurity, information systems, and data science (do a stats major instead) are not as good.As for knowing what you want to specialize in I don't think there are any shortcuts besides trying stuff and seeing if you like it. Either take a class or build a project and see if it's cool. You can also research online about the different cs disciplines. If you decide on embedded systems I think computer or elctrical engineering is a better major, but it prob depends on the school.Regarding how economically cooked the different cs subdisciplines are, they honestly aren't that cooked. What's (or rather who) is cooked is the person who graduates, has no extracurricular experience, and is only interested in the doing bare minimum to get money.The truth is that cs isn't an easy path to 6 figures. You either need to genuinely like it or be very disciplined because the degree is only like 30-40% of the puzzle.

But other than that, the thing is stable and ""it just works"". Whereas the newest thing can have multiple open issues.Is the newest thing actually maintained? Recently I had to make a technical analysis for a new microservice and had to come up with an architecture proposal for it. I considered different alternatives. There was a library A and a library B. Library A had been around for many years. Sure, it had a lot of bloat and stuff, but it worked. Library B also seemed to work. Less bloat. Promising. BUT the maintainer/developer/owner of that library had abandoned that project. For 2 years there had been no commits. Github issues were abandoned. Yes, that B was newer than A but it was abandoned. Whereas A was older, did have more bloat, but was in active maintenance. Recent commits to update versions. Recent commits to fix vulnerabilities. etc.Is the newest thing that you should consider in the current geopolitical world? Let's say you are a developer in the US. Will you use a library made in China, in Russia, or in Iran? By itself the library can be newer and perhaps also better. BUT the decision makers can start making decisions where they tell the developers to make the library close sourced and you won't have any overview of the changes. Decision makers can introduce kill switches or backdoors. Or, the developers will collect data and send it to their data brokers. And then that data will be used in a competitive manner. One of the many reasons why one should think twice if he should use Deepseek AI, for example. Technically very promising LLM model. Also, it introduced many changes to other LLMs in the world. But, it follows the political agenda of China. It is not neutral.Does the newest thing have enough documentation? Older stuff can have massive documentation compiled by many developers over years. A new thing can have close to no documentation and you have to be one of the pioneers creating that documentation on the go.How is the new thing fitting in the existing infrastructure? Perhaps it does not even work? Yes, stuff often is meant to be backwards compatible, but not always it is the case. For example Spring Boot 2.x vs Spring Boot 3.x and different libraries. Some newer libraries expect you to use also newer Spring Boot version. Also newer Java version. You can't just throw the newest library in the code and hope that stuff works.Do you have resources (time, budget) to make upgrades to support the newest tools and the newest versions?How will you balance constant upgrades with adding new functionality and maintaining the project as a whole? A new library version can come out every month, for example. Will you concentrate on version upgrades over working what the client actually cares about? It is difficult to ""sell"" version upgrades to a client. You have to prove that it is needed. Yes, Dependabot is a thing but some time will still go into reviewing its MRs and doing smoke testing to ensure that untestable stuff (for whichever reason) works.With you updating stuff, will you break something that external service providers are using?

nud88sk,"I like the TODO application as a first project because it is a small thing you can grow one small thing at a time as you learn and grow with it.What I mean by that is start with a good TODO tutorial and get that into GitHub as your first project. Run it on GitHub Pages so now it is on the Internet too. Good stuff to learn to get that far. Then add the next small thing by adding a backend server and modify your TODO application to POST tasks there instead. POST, GET, UPDATE, DELETE are REST verbs you can learn about. Just print the tasks to the console for now. Once you have that working add a database and save a POSTed task to the database using SQL. INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE are SQL statements that map directly to the REST verbs and they are often referred to as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Fill in the GET (SELECT) request to retrieve your tasks, the UPDATE, then DELETE. Now your application is full stack.Let the projects you pick guide what you need to learn, when you need to learn it. MDN is a great resource for the frontend and there are many great resources for whatever backend and database you choose.As you build this, you are doing all of this locally, frontend, backend, database, and committing changes to git and pushing those changes to your GitHub repo as you go. To get your GitHub Pages frontend to talk to your backend running on your local machine you can learn about CORS (allows your frontend to talk to your backend) to add that to your backend then use \`ngrok\` to temporarily expose your server and port to the internet (only works while \`ngrok\` and your computer are running).Now that you have a full stack application running on the Internet, time to learn about authentication to make it so only registered users can access your server. You will add login/logout to your frontend and backend as well as user management. More REST and CRUD stuff to add for that too.Cloud stuff is next to get all of it running on the internet. That is a later topic.Whatever projects you pick, build projects as completely as you can. Make them full stack if that is your thing. Take TODO and add subscriptions/payments, member management, calendar schedules, email/sms reminders, single-sign on, SaaS deployment (cloud), whatever else you can think of. If you just do frontend, touch every angle of it in your projects.This is a possible roadmap for you that will keep you busy and hopefully motivated for a while.

nu4ufej,"Picture yourself in the early 1980s. There is no internet. There barely are any knowledgeable people in your area. Formal programming education is basically non existent before University.All you have is the *documentation manual* for the programming language.How do you learn?Through experimentation. You have no resources, so the only thing you can do is play around, try things. Fail. Try more. Fail again. Try more and eventually succeed.You won't learn by copying tutorial or stackoverflow, etc. code. You will only learn by creating your own code, even if that means that your solutions are maybe complicated, convoluted, and sub-optimal. Yet, they are *your* solutions. They stem from *your thought process*. This way, you *learn*.Once you have a working solution, there is no harm in looking up how others have solved the problems. This way, you can learn better, more optimized approaches. Yet, first *you* need to figure out a solution.The notion of directly looking for solutions via the internet is detrimental to learning, even more so in the current age of permanent availability of the internet, and worse, with the advent of AI. It makes us lazy. It makes us stopping to think analytically. It makes us stop investing effort, because ""why should we when everything is readily available?"". In return, it makes us stop actually *learning*. Learning means struggling. Learning means failing. Learning means debugging. Learning does not mean getting a solution from effectively a third party (no matter if Google, Stackoverflow, AI, etc.)Discipline yourself to not looking for direct solutions and even less *in code*, but to look for *approaches* to solutions. Maybe, download the documentation for your programming language and then cut yourself off the internet. Seems like a radical step, but can be extremely helpful for learning.The thought process from problem to solution is what really counts in programming, not the *implementation* in a programming language (that's the more trivial part and just a necessary evil).Once you understand how to ""think like a programmer"" things change considerably. Programming languages become less important and you learn to work on a more abstract, conceptional level.Maybe, try some programming competitions, like [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) (with the accompanying subreddit /r/adventofcode) - current year is over, but the challenges are all accessible back to the very first season in 2015. Another recommendable site is [Exercism](https://exercism.org). Here, you get challenges and have ""hints"" and guidance.As usual with such posts (of which there are more than plenty), some Literature (aka *books*):+ ""Think Like A Programmer"" by V. Anton Spraul+ ""The Pragmatic Programmer"" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas+ ""Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman+ ""Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software"" by Charles PetzoldTo address your ""all coders do is just copy-paste"" statement: yes, we do copy paste, but not because we *could not do the job*, it's because of time constraints, trusted and tested solutions. Contrary to a beginner/learner, we can assess what a solution copied from the internet does, how it fits into our codebase, what side effects it has, etc. We could come up with our own solutions, but that would be less efficient in a professional setting than to resort to tested and trusted solutions.",aqua_regis,2025-12-15 10:24:10,16,learnprogramming,t3_1pmzjoe,False,

Both of them have had two totally different experiences, but surprisingly, both have ended up in the same place doing the exact same thing. One of them was a self taught developer who tinkered with programming at a young age and learned many languages. Unfortunately, he didn’t pursue a CS degree because he grew up very poor but is in the works of getting one right now. This dude had many personal projects under his belt and worked extensively outside of work getting tasks at work completed. He had around 15 years of experience working with software and loved programming. He knew embedded programming really well too including how PLCs work and loved learning new things about programming. The other had a CE degree from Michigan Tech and has around 15 years of experience. He worked with embedded programming for the bulk of his career at GE Aviation. He really enjoys learning about new technologies and currently is helping us bring into the modern era an older application. This dude is my current mentor and has taught me so much in terms of how to program and ultimately, how to go about architecting and designing programs. He is a monster, he designed a completely new product from an older application at my company and reverse engineered the way it works so that it translated properly to a new language and environment. My coworkers had told him that the old project was a mess since it was written with a very old version of C++ (to most of us it was a mess lol). But he straight up in the interview said “nothing scared him”. My bosses laughed at him but he proved US ALL wrong. The thing about both of them that made them really good engineers was that both of them explicitly stated to me that all they did was “breathe and live” code. They programmed on all their free time and worked many hours outside of the usual 40 hour work week perfecting their craft. They read books, watched videos, they absorbed so much information on their free time that it clearly showed when they came into work ready to start their day. Like I feel helpless sometimes just seeing that they can take on so many tasks (especially tough ones) and my tasks I complete are mediocre at best. But the thing is, I am absorbing the knowledge they give to me. I’ve learned so much from starting my position that I don’t think I would be anywhere near where I am in knowledge and experience without either of them.",scub_101,2025-12-16 20:10:58,4,cscareerquestions,t3_1po9nxk,False,

There's no one breathing down your neck while you problem-solve. The time pressure, high stakes, and interviewers disrupting your thought process aren't simulated.

nuypa72,"Generally its going to be YOE because the more time spent means the more problems/situations you face. Even if problems seem similar it may show up with a different constraint and you the solution you'd normally do for that problem might no longer be effective or even feasible. Basically you get an increased scope of knowledge on top of the hindsight of knowing what approaches works well in a situation of multiple approaches being ""correct"".In the example you gave the big thing is scope. You can design and architect a website or microservice but also remember generally thats an extremely small scope and more than likely is a solved problem. Like anyone could go on some system design prep site and know how to design and architect twitter or facebook or some trading site. Where the seniority in that comes in is knowing why you may want to take some approaches vs others based on needs because you've had prior experience making such calls. Often time what you think in your head or what works on paper doesn't play out the same in reality and there tends to be a lot of edge cases that are missed.What makes the big n experience so valuable is because you get exposed to a unique scale problem. Because they work around stuff so big they get to see the extreme edge cases a little more frequently even if theyll never directly work on it but just that visibility is so valuable especially to similar sized companies. But you can turn around and see big n employees might not do well at a smaller company because the breadth of tools they need to know how to use might be something they never even have had to touch or think about previously. Or that scale isnt the big issue and theres another type of problem that needs to be solved.Like if you can crank out a business/ecom site effectively without much help or guidance (this includes truly understanding the business reasons behind what your developing) you are probably a senior at a non tech non super huge scaled company. But you wont be a senior at a company where scale matters and vice versa.You could be a senior level expert at CUDA programming and then be junior at cloud stuff.

As a junior engineer, you can't decide this, but you can get the conversation going. ""Hey, what happens if...?""Second, if there is no such procedure in place, then - all things being equal - I'm probably going to the concert. If it's one I could stand to miss, then maybe I'm making an offer: Cover the cost of my tickets plus something for the trouble. Something like that. But me helping you above and beyond the normal agreement is a favor, and sometimes I'm not in a position to grant you that favor. Boundaries are important.However, I'm also going to try to be accommodating within reason. In a situation like that, I'd offer to check in when I get back from the concert. If the issue's still ongoing, then perhaps some responsibility could be handed off to me so that others can get a break. This is probably really helpful as a junior, because while you might not be the best help for the initial incident, there can often be follow-up work that is less intensive. Like someone needs to run a database query every five minutes and make sure A stays less than B, until we can get the alert automation in place. And if I'm on the primary crew and I've been at it for six hours and a junior comes in at midnight and says, ""How can I help?"" you bet I'll hand that over and get some sleep.Finally, there's also the issue of Emergency Theatre. Do we really need all hands on deck? Or do we need the appearance that we're busting our butts to get it working again? There's not much you can do about this in the moment except recognize it and deal with it later. Figure out why this is the case.

At my last job I was involved in hiring, and we would always get at least 1,000 applications in the first 24 hours after posting, usually we'd end up with 3-5k. We started with a code screen, basically a couple LC easy questions, that usually got us down to a few hundred. Then we'd divvy up the resumes and mark them as reject or pass. It was a quick glance maybe 5 seconds each resume to see if they had the basic qualifications, the vast majority of those failed. Then we'd be down to \~20-50 people and we'd have our HR do a phone screen, basically ask about their basic qualifications, make sure they're interested in the job at the salary range we're offering and the tech stack they'd be working on. We rarely rejected anyone in this round but many took themselves out of the running so typically we'd be down to 10-20 at that point. Then we'd have the hiring manager have a phone screen with them. If they made it to this point they had something on their resume we liked, so we'd typically ask them about it and really drill down and ask for excruciating detail to make sure they actually did it. Spoiler alert, most people are exaggerating and/or lying about their specific contribution to a project on their resume, and it's super easy to weed out. That got us down to \~5 which we would invite to interview.Once we selected to interview them, I would then read a cover letter if they sent one, although I think a lot of other folks didn't even read them then. This is also the point I would look at their github if they had one on their resume or anything else they included as side projects. I think I was one of the few people involved in hiring who did any of that most would just look at the resume 10 minutes before the interview. Then the interview was with a few folks, we had one do a tech screen where we give them a sample problem and watch them code, change requirements and see how they adapt. One does a culture fit interview where they ask questions related to soft skills, how do you handle conflict, those types of questions. One is a business round where our product person asks them some questions related to our business and some basic logic questions to see if they can reason through product requirement type things. Then everyone meets and ranks the candidates, we come up with a consensus order, and send the offer out to the first one, if they decline send the offer to the second one, etc. It's also possible at that point that some people just get a fail so even if they're the highest rated candidate we'd rather restart the process than hire them, although that's rare most people who've made it to this stage are at least getting hired if they're the best candidate interviewing for that role who accept because as you can see it's a long and painful process and we'd rather not start over.",Inner_Butterfly1991,2025-12-18 05:42:44,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1ppbbyg,False,
nulqrcx,"> In an ideal scenario, an applicant who is enthusiastic, writes a cover letter etc. should get an interview, Bullshit. In what world, and from which perspective, is that even remotely close to ideal?Skills and execution. It doesn't fucking matter if you like doing it or not, so long as you actually do it, and do and do it well.I'll happily admit there is some correlation between the quality of your output and how much joy your work brings you, but it's not 1:1.>but I heard already from some managers that they completely don't look at cover letters due to lack of time, CV is more optimized. Another person instead recommended me to write a cover letter, as it is a way to stand out, especially for relatively junior roles with many applicants.If you're submitting an application, you are selling yourself. No salesperson in the history of ever has tried to get their counterpart to just read the product description. They want face time, to tell the story of their product, to make an emotional appeal.Do you think they send out empty e-mails, with just the technical specs attached and the words ""for your kind consideration""? Or do you think they will use every sentence, every square inch of screen real-estate that they can get to make the other side interested in a conversation?Why on earth would anyone believe that the proven process would work differently when the opportunity you want them to grasp is yourself?For what it's worth, I currently going through my first hiring process on the employer side - I am sitting past an HR filter, so I don't even know if there were any cover letters; I wasn't giving any. But I can tell you this: The majority (of a very, very small pool) of CVs I have seen would not get a pass from me; there's too many slightly reddish flags, and as desperate as I am to work with a larger team, I simply don't have the time to allow someone to correct the misconceptions that their CV has created in the first place.But I would have read a cover letter; I would have read a slightly more detailed CV, and some of the things that tripped me up could have potentially been explained away. Who we invite is not entirely my choice, but I do get a say.And your problem is: I don't aim to be fair, I don't give a damn about giving you a chance. I care about filling a vacancy with someone who primarily has the right skills, enough experience and who I can stand having to talk to a few times a week.And if I know one thing it is this: Once we do hire someone, I lose my voice. I can't get them fired if I think they're a dud, or hard to get along with, so - for my own sake - I have to be very careful and weigh working in a team that's too small vs. working with someone I don't want to work with.And then, neither a CV or a cover letter take eons to write, or to customize for a specific position. Make your documents modular; have blocks that you can shift around if needed, and templates that you can remove or include.Believe me, I write cover letters when I apply for jobs. I have zero proof and no data to show that they work - but I really don't see a world where it's not worth the bit of extra effort.",okayifimust,2025-12-18 00:03:40,8,cscareerquestions,t3_1ppbbyg,False,

nu4kaw5,"If another developer’s actions create obstacles that make your work more difficult, it is reasonable to raise those obstacles with your manager or whoever can address them. The focus should stay on the obstacle that is blocking you, not on the developer as a person.This framing positions you as someone trying to improve results for the company by identifying obstacles, rather than as someone “reporting” on a coworker. It avoids unnecessary interpersonal conflict and reduces the risk of backlash if your manager interprets it as a personal complaint.If the other developer’s behavior does not produce obstacles that actually impede your work, it is usually best to ignore it. Spending time and energy evaluating another person’s work habits is a distraction from producing strong results yourself.**Responding to your edit:** you’re saying that when your coworkers don’t do their work, you end up working overtime and feeling pressure to meet deadlines. That overtime and deadline pressure is the real obstacle being created by their lack of follow-through.That’s understandably frustrating. The right response is to communicate clearly with your manager about project status and work allocation. When work is assigned but not completed, you should state that the project is off track, explain that tasks are being reallocated, and explicitly note either that you are working overtime to meet deadlines or that deadlines will slip as a result of the reallocation.This gives your manager the opportunity to recognize and credit your extra effort, or to see that deadlines are being missed because work isn’t getting done and needs to be reassigned. Ideally, this leads them to independently notice that a particular coworker is consistently not completing their work.If your manager does not acknowledge your overtime and instead simply pressures you to work harder, then the issue is poor management.

So its a process feature, literally no programming, you could get it done in 1 hour by click click click > done. But I decided to present it on a review meeting and instead of the typical boring power point slides that engineers talk through to present their work, I decided to make it dramatic. Kinda like a thriller. I looked up articles on what happens if Secrets arent stored in a key vault. And I got a couple news articles about Uber for example or some other companies in which their credentials like API keys weren't securely stored and thus a breach happened.

Mind you, I started out working on build systems at FAANG, and it was very different than what it is today. The trick is to find platform teams that are hiring SWEs where you can build tools that take the pain of infrastructure off of the product teams.There are a lot of DevOps/SRE roles that intersect this space and are 90% config-writing (infrastructure as code), but if you can get into writing custom Terraform modules and Kubernetes controllers you'll be highly sought after. I had a recruiter recently tell me that they pay their platform SWEs more than their backend or frontend SWEs because they're more specialized and harder to find. It's not for everyone, but give it a solid try, you won't be boxing yourself in (at least this early in your career). I have specialized in this role for 10 years so I show up in searches for senior positions. Recruiters that find me for product teams will usually end up having the hiring manager reject my resume because I haven't worked on product for a decade.

Not that there's anything wrong with enjoying better tools and environment - but careers are long and tweaking your setup isn't going to keep you motivated beyond the next few months, let alone decades.But all that said - you aren't entirely wrong. This is both a job and a career, and if you're not learning stuff or getting growth opportunities then that isn't good. You won't always have interesting things to build, but if you never get that then you're going to stagnate and that's where people run into trouble finding new jobs.You should be able to work with your manager to identify some growth areas and find some tickets where you can learn something. That's a perfectly reasonable expectation. But the key is to focus on what you can learn and what new skills you can build: it being ""exciting"" doesn't really enter into it.",olddev-jobhunt,2025-12-20 15:13:01,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1praho3,False,

I started learning C# early on in life because I loved video games and wanted to make them, there were two primary languages you could accomplish that with back then (this was about 20 years ago) C# with the XNA framework, or C++ with a library like SDL. XNA transitioned to monogame, and SDL is now SDL2. I believe Unity was around but it wasn't popular yet, unreal engine existed but the commercial license was expensive. I went with learning C# because I wanted to make games for the Xbox 360 and monogame was free to use, which I did, I launched two games before finding work in the industry doing web development. That was my path and it worked well for me.In your case, because you have a heavy math background and you're only interested in learning id try LISP or maybe Python. Those are less marketable languages but have heavier focuses on Math.Any mainstream language to start is a good one though. Game programming is fairly math intensive which you might enjoy but it's very labor intensive and requires a knack for art , if you don't mind trying to make your own graphics and aren't all that concerned about design philosophy then id still recommend C# and monogame.

If you get past the sentence above, then think like an investor and ask them the hard questions. Do not hold back. Go hard on them. If they're competent and experienced entrepreneurs, they should welcome these types of questions from anyone they want to bring on board. After all, they're effectively asking you to be an investor, not just an employee:* Does either founder have any past experience running any kind of business?* Has either founder ever founded a startup before? If so, what was the outcome?* Ask to see their pitch deck, for them to give you the pitch.* Are they already seeking investment? I would imagine they must be if they don't have any cash of their own to invest. Ask to get a detailed report on their efforts so far and why they haven't found investment yet* Does either of them have any connections to people with capital (VCs, angel investors, etc.)?* Ask the hard questions: How soon do you expect to get funding? What is your contingency plan if that gets delayed?
