Since people are going to suspect LLMs anyway, I used one to try to reorganize it.I would probably add some testing too.---# Data Engineering Pipeline Checklist## 1. Requirements First- **SLA**: How fresh? (minutes/hours/daily) Daily reporting → no streaming needed- **Impact**: Cost of being late/wrong?- **Consumer**: Dashboards, ML, reporting?## 2. Architecture**Single source of truth**: One storage layer (warehouse/lakehouse/object storage). Everything reads from it.**Batch over streaming**: Streaming adds complexity (ordering, retries, idempotency, late events, backfills). Default to batch unless real-time is essential.**Design for backfills**: Parameterized date ranges, versioned transforms, separate raw/modeled layers.## 3. Reliability**Idempotency**: Jobs must be safely rerunnable via partitioned outputs, overwrite-by-partition/merge strategies, deterministic keys.**Orchestration**: Use Airflow/Dagster/Prefect for retries, dependencies, visibility, parameterized runs. Avoid ""cron spaghetti.""## 4. Observability**Minimum to prevent silent failures**:- Row counts/volume checks- Freshness checks- Schema drift alerts- Job duration tracking## 5. Performance**Optimize last**. Most slowness comes from bad joins, file layout, or moving too much data—not lack of Spark.**Fix basics first**: Partitioning, columnar formats, filter pushdown, avoid cartesian joins.## 6. Simplicity Rule**If your SLA is met with**: scheduler + Python/SQL + storage + basic checks**Then distributed systems add unnecessary complexity.****Use distributed systems when**:- Volume exceeds single-machine capacity (hundreds GB–TBs)- True real-time requirements (sub-minute)- Complex streaming aggregations- Multiple concurrent consumers need isolation",sib_n,2025-12-19 01:49:33,11,dataengineering,t3_1ppuky6,False,

The ""streaming only when it pays rent"" line is perfect.My guardrails are similar:**When I don't need Kafka/streaming:*** Data freshness SLA is > 5 minutes* No multiple consumers needing to replay the same events* Backfills are the common case, not real-time reactions**When I actually reach for it:*** Multiple independent systems need to react to the same event* I need replay (reprocess from a specific point in time)* Upstream is bursty and I need to buffer/decouple from the DBEven then, Kafka is usually overkill. Something lighter like Liftbridge (Kafka semantics, single Go binary, no JVM/ZooKeeper) or just NATS JetStream covers 90% of cases.On the storage side - totally agree on ""one source of truth, columnar, object storage."" We're building Arc with exactly this mindset: DuckDB for compute, Parquet for storage, S3-compatible backend.

For the first three months or so, while building the team, everything was smooth. But after that, I started feeling more or less the same way you described. When you’re the decision-maker, from system design to the nitty-gritty details, you’re also the one who gets blamed when things don’t work out. At one point, I even felt that juniors were contributing more than me because I was stuck in a loop of wrong decisions. But that’s okay. We are engineers, and we are supposed to try, fail, and learn until something works out. It can feel overwhelming to be your own north star at the beginning. I hope you start figuring things out soon. During my own period of doubt, my CTO once told me, “I’m happy that you’re demotivated. It shows you’re serious about your work, and when things don’t work out, you feel disappointed. That’s a great engineer trait.” So you do have a great engineer trait.

Use draw.io or something like that to draw your architecture, and share that with your team before building it and review it to see if it is foolproof.

Unfortunately, nothing is more permanent than a temporary solution, and things often languish in MVP stage far longer than you’ll ever expect. Often the MVP is the P, and you’ll have to live with whatever architecture was originally built. Spreadsheet for a POC? Maybe… but MVP? Often a bad idea. For a website just displaying some data… probably a fine solution I grant you. But for anything more complex, no. How are you handling pushing the data? Do you have a Dev/PPE/Prod spreadsheet? Do you run tests to validate the data before it gets pushed live? How are you managing the schema of the spreadsheet against your application layer? What if you need to roll back? If your client can’t handle using git or some other workflow to update the data, I’d want some substantial guard rails in place if I am letting them edit production data. At least some type of defined deployment flow with validation and integration testing. A cloud hosted DB has pretty minimal costs. Databases have tons of advantages, but the one of the most important is they are robust and conform to a design standard with means that the next guy who comes along wont be stuck unpicking a bespoke spreadsheet solution.Also, DBs are not the only solution.

nvcj7ub,"I'm doing a similar role, although at a very small firm - similarly no data culture to speak of, messy and fragmented processes and systems etc. I wouldn't have chosen it necessarily but some life circumstances have led me to it as a necessity at least in the short term. I'm also a humanities graduate who did the same pivot about 6 years ago.The major problem really is having zero reliability on upstream data which makes all analytics really difficult to do well. And cultural transformation is as important as technical in that scenario so you need to ask yourself if that's something you're willing to engage in - personally I feel the payoff is too uncertain versus the effort. On the generalist vs specialist question: you could stay a generalist if you want to go down one of 2 paths: 1) moving into management as quickly as possible or 2) carving out a niche as the 'first data hire'. In the second case, companies with no data team want a full stack data engineer / analyst / scientist who can do a bit of everything without investing in a whole team.If neither of those appeal, I would figure out what you enjoy most and focus on that. At least that's what I'm doing at my current place:1) building pipelines to move data around - focus on data engineering2) transforming data into usable, analytics ready data sets - analytics engineering3) speaking to stakeholders, answering business questions and building end user visualisation and analysis - data analyst4) building statistical / predictive models - data scientist6) strategy, leadership, management - project management, productI'm figuring out what I like most about the job, focusing efforts for the next 6 months on building stuff for that role specifically. Then I'm job hunting. This can be quite difficult given the demands of your firm might not align with what you want to do - e.g. if you want to be a data engineer and learn how to set up airflow on AWS but you've already got a vaguely usable set up using different tech, saying 'I want to learn this' might not cut it as a business case. You might have to figure out a way to be creative with the truth to get your way in that scenario, but honestly that's where your humanities background kicks in lol.So my personal take with these kinds of roles is that they rarely make sense long term. Use it to get the experience you want and feel you need and then move on to something else.You mentioned you like the architecture and design piece of the job - that's a good starting point and probably puts you more in the data engineering camp of the 6 roles above. Unfortunately 'architect' roles tend to be quite senior and you need to have some grunt work under your belt before unlocking those, but I imagine data engineering is the right place for that.Your tech stack is already a great starting point and tbh a good team will see python and SQL experience as enough - anything else is just learning tooling and reading the docs. I also think hiring someone who has stood up a serviceable stack on a shoestring budget with some creativity should be a more interesting profile than someone who just sets up Fivetran and Snowflake and calls it a day. But it might be worth just thinking through a simple pipeline and making sure you can talk credibly about all components of it - e.g. an orchestrator like airflow, a warehouse like BQ or Snowflake, etc. I think a good resource could be something like the Zoomcamp data engineering course - you could take a look at their materials and see if you can implement some of it at work.",Psychological-Suit-5,2025-12-22 10:11:50,10,dataengineering,t3_1psvmt2,False,

I'd say that's true of pretty much any role that's not the 'prototypical' FAANG data engineering role. It sounds to me like you're doing quite a good job given the situation. > Is it wise to be a generalist in the long run? Is there a point at which choosing a lane (engineering, product, analytics, etc.) makes more sense than leaning into this builder profile?This is just my opinion, and there are many opinions on this topic. I personally have always leaned a bit more toward being a generalist, and it has served me well. I also pivoted from a humanities background (linguistics), and whether this is true or not, I've internalized that I'm never going to be the whiz kid of hard coding skills and deep mathematical and algorithmic knowledge. I do think a humanities background tends to help with communication, asking questions, and defining a problem, especially compared to many of the pure CS grads I've worked with. On some level the tools don't *really* matter too much, you're solving a similar set of problems and you'll have to use whatever tools the company you work for has available. I lean on my ability to learn when I've had to pick up new tools, workflows, and programming languages - so far so good.Obviously it's good to have a few areas where you build deep expertise, but I think this happens as a matter of course for most people anyway. I think there's probably some trade off where deeply specializing early on can net you higher pay sooner, with a somewhat higher risk of getting really good at something that doesn't exist in a few years. All of that being said, we're really talking about two extreme ends of a spectrum.

Edit: This is maybe a useless or incorrect comment; I honestly don't know what a recruiter or hiring manager would stop and look at more when faced with a stack of CVs/resumes...I've been in a similar space for the 7 years I've been in a data-focused role - my team has been a team of 2 ICs the entire time. We have a business-oriented manager now. For a little while we had a data architect. But, in a lot of ways it has been me wearing hats for platform admin/architect/engineer/modeller/analyst/visualiser. For a bit over a year I've been titled Lead Data Engineer.It's absolutely tough being at the end of the chain as some sort of generalist mid-to-senior. Apart from the year or so I worked with the architect who'd been around a while, I've had to learn a lot on my own, and from the internet, and from paid-for consultants.Whether you want to generalise or specialise depends on your goals, I think. I like the variety of experience and work that can come from being a generalist. I think I am just that way inclined, though, jack-of-all-trades kind of thing. But, in my career, I don't think I've been a proper specialist, so :man_shrugging: Another way to look at it is breadth rather than depth of expertise.

The job is to solve problems and achieve real-world objectives. Sometimes to do that we have to consider other constraints on the problem space, such as:- ""this technology is inferior, but it's battle tested and has loads of technical support staff backing it; we can't afford the risk of a new system going down and having no way to fix it""- ""this technology is old, and therefore I can easily hire people who already know it, and there is a lot of documentation; the new one is great on paper but we need experienced staff to maintain it, and they are hard to find""- ""this new technology is better than what we currently have in terms of technical performance, but we've rigged up enough custom ameliorations around the existing core tech that we will realise hardly any real world gains from switching""- ""we would benefit from switching technologies in a measurable way, saving £50,000 per year, but it would take this entire team six months of work to move all our legacy code onto it. They have other, more pressing priorities and the benefit doesn't outweigh the cost of hiring a team of contractors to do it.""But let's say you think there's a big pool of potential adopters for whom SQLMesh II would make business sense. It's not so easy to take a slightly superior technology and turn that into a going concern. dbt has mass adoption.Are you personally planning to fork SQLMesh and spend a substantial chunk of your time maintaining it, if Fivetran strip the original for parts? Perhaps you will fund this via a hosted version - will you be picking up the phone to pitch it to companies yourself, or will you use your own money to pay someone to do that?What will you do if Fivetran freak out as soon as you get traction and throw a bunch of engineers at making dbt good enough to kill your competitive advantage? Unlike SQLMesh-original-flavour, you don't have proprietary code; Fivetran have access to the same stuff plus a lot more resources.Remember, you _only_ get acquired if it makes business sense to them to spend the money on buying you out ... instead of on using their own engineering team to outcompete you.

PL route tends to make a higher bonus but you can still make very good money as IC so both are viable paths. I know many engineers who have stayed at the level you are at their entire career. Only a few percent move up from here. This is because a new set of skills are required. You are no longer just coding 8 hours per day.

Unfortunately almost no one will tell you that simply doing great work in your role doesn’t make you eligible for a promotion to the next one. Unless you demonstrate the skills required for the next level you will not even be viewed as a viable candidate by others. In practice this usually looks like partnering with business stakeholders to define a problem or need, designing a solution that addresses that problem or need, and organizing a team of engineers to deliver this solution.

Good code paired with good engineers that understand the code and know how to locate issues, fix them, support customers and add features on what they have without disturbing what they did before is not.I've seen lots of junior engineers using AI tools as fit for all tools which result in many of them being clueless of what's going on. That's a tremendous risk for a company. When something goes wrong things goes wrong in a big way. Tools have no accountability or responsibility but engineers do. Tip for engineers out there: AI tools are a game changer but NEVER deploy code you don't understand.> Unit tests and component-specific tests are worthlessMaybe if you miss what's the purpose of unit tests. I see lots of engineers using unit tests to give them coverage or just as a way to look responsible but mostly the tests are so tied to the components that are not testing anything specific. If there are edge cases on potencial user inputs that should be tested to guarantee that no one removes the actual piece of code that does the validation or fallback on the inputs. So I would say: bad tests are detrimental, good tests are amazing guard rails.> Dependencies has to be explicitSounds like a no-brainer but it's actually hard to enforce that because many teams/engineers lack the discipline to do so and only value that once the s* hits the fan (somehow similar to skipping the tests)> nowadays you can build something in 1 hour and wait 2-3 days for reviewBad engineering culture drives that. Mostly people are valued by the litres of code they add or the features they add (even if unbaked). Code reviews are good for aligning, learning and guaranteeing some standards. Running pipelines costs time and money so it's not the case they are free. So maybe code reviews investment might be something people should lean on.> REALLY GOOD data engineer (that can communicate well with business, solid data modeling skills, deep technical expertise to design efficient storage/compute, etc) rather than hiring 5 “okay” data engineersNot that linear.

You need to make sure that everyone understand what's going on and why the things are the way they are, that's essential part of leadership. When it comes to ambiguity and a decision needs to be made you need someone that is a good leader and has a strong sponsor (CTO, VP, Director...).If there is no leadership, sense of direction and accountability/responsibility is something exoteric even the best engineer will not be able to do the change and in that case maybe the 5 cheaper engineers might ship out more (despite risking shipping the wrong things at the wrong time with arguable quality).So, in other words, your 5 cheap engineers are not an alternative to the ""good"" engineer but rather a combination of both.",erbr,2025-12-20 20:27:20,3,dataengineering,t3_1prl5t5,False,

nviu0rs,"Yep, so this is a pattern dbt uses regularly. I am fairly new as well (been reading/learning for what seems like years, but work doesn’t want to go down this route).Basically, the idea is you bring each referenced source table in to the model you’re working on as their own cte. By doing this pattern you have a clear reference to every parent model you are using at the top of your model.You then perform the transformation steps, including the joining of those referenced tables as the next cte (or several ctes depending on complexity).Then you read directly out of your last cte - preferably with little transformation in the final step.All of this is to make things as readable and organised as possible.If you were to start transforming each source in the initial cte, you wouldnt be reading a simple, single line bringing it in to the current model, but reading more complex transformations that you would need to spend more time figuring out what that piece was doing and where it began and ended.Edit to add: this way you can tell at a glance at the top of your model all the referenced sources. Each of them as a single line cte with no complexity thrown in. After you have brought in each source as its own cte, then you start a new one with a name indicating the source and transformation step, etc.By bringing in your sources, transforming each, joining, performing joined transformations, aggregating, etc, each in a little code block cte, you are mimicking how programmers would use methods in code to logically break code into chunks.If you also read up about layering data models (medallion architecture), you’ll see how dbt likes to break it down further into separate models. This allows you to perform the simple single-model transformations, such as renaming, casting, etc at a ”silver” stage, and more complex transformations such as joining or calculating the values in two tables, aggregating, etc in a later, “gold” model. This takes the organising and simplifying of models from within a single model/step, to a process.——- /* Model header and configuration */ // bring in referenced models and sources WITH orders AS ( SELECT * FROM source_orders ), customers AS ( SELECT * FROM source_customers ) // transform table transform_orders AS ( SELECT col1 AS col1_rename, col2 AS cast(col2 AS string), .....

You can also define simple tests or expectations that a column shouldn’t have NULL values, or fields need to be of a specific types and and and …Anything you can envision will happen eventually. And most often it requires human intervention to be fixed because most likely you need to talk to other people to either fix it at the source or you need to adjust the data pipeline to handle the new case. Your time is best spend in investing in detection and observability so you can spot the reason for the failure quickly.One way to minimize your disruption (and this is used in more mature organisations) is to create data contracts with your source system owners.

nvepmti,"I didnt actively intend to make the switch until I was pretty far along down the path. Biggest driver is DE comes with higher pay than being a DBA. In my current role I still wear both hats fairly regurlarly. In fact I was hired more for my DBA skills than my DE skills.That said I found all the following skills very helpful in making the switch. 1. Expert level Powershell knowledge. This comes in handy both on prem and in thr cloud if you regurlarly work with Microsoft stacks. If not Bash would be more useful. 2. Intermediate Python skills. I learned python after powershell and the knowledge transfers easily between them. Somethings when you know both get hard just from do pythonism or powershellism in the other language. In Python focus on learning the common DE packages like pandas, polars, SqlAlchemy, pyodbc, requests these will get used constantly when writing pipelines for rest api endpoints. Dont worry too much about getting into the weeds with oop as most pipelines are not written that way. 3. If you want to go one step further learn Pyspark which is hugely useful in cloud pipelines and datalakes. Azure data factory, Databricks, etc is just spark underneath the sheets. 4. As a DBA for 10 years before making the switch. I was very familiar with On Prem / runnung SQL on VMs. A big switch for me was learning PaaS offerings like snowflake, databricks, Azure SQL, Azure data factory. So spending time learning the basics on these helped. I got lucky and was dealing with vendors / clients using these services so got paid to learn on thr job as it were. 5. Many older DBAs still have yet to embrace source control. If you are in this boat learn source control, ci/cd, and managing databases as code. If you get these under you belt it will make life better as a DBA and a DE. 6. Communication skills.

nuvmtdt,"tl;dr: I wouldnt necessarily advice to use Snowflake as operational database. As an analytical database, it might help you if the analysts are experiencing timeouts and/or slow queries Depends on how much data you have. Are analysts experiencing problems when they run queries on MySQL? And if they are, are you sure this is a problem related to the amount of data or could it be due to a bad-indexed db or small ec2 instance used to query?By design, Snowflake is not made to be an operational database. There is a new table format called Interactive Table, which according to the documentation is basically the way you would use Snowflake for transactional data (low-latency + high concurrency). It is, however, also written that you get best performance by querying that table with a Interactive Warehouse, which - and here's the catch - is by default ON all the time (which will sky-rocket your costs)If the analysts are experiencing slow queries, then replicating databases in Snowflake will definitely (most likely) help. In this case, I would leave the MySQL database as your operational database and replicate them in Snowflake, where analysts would only query from there (given that they are ok with some delay in the data compared to the data in MySQL). You'll spend a bit less with the AWS instances used to query data, but I'm pretty sure your Snowflake bill will more than compensate that decrease.Btw, I move data from MySQL to Snowflake doing exactly that: lambda -> s3 -> Snowflake (using Tasks) + PowerBI. Very quick to get it up and running (with a first load done with DMS), but given that lambda is not really made for this kind of task (there's a 15min hard timeout in the lambda), I'm on the process of moving that into fargate.",maxbranor,2025-12-19 15:44:03,1,dataengineering,t3_1pqncik,False,

nvh1sos,In C and C++ storage for every variable (object for example) you have goes on the stack in your current stack frame. When you return from your function that stack frame is released. Thus inherently every variable/object you make in code would be released when you return from your function if it is not a pointer of some kind. Creating storage which a pointer points to (by using new for example) means the object is able to live past your function call.,xilvar,2025-12-23 01:56:26,14,learnprogramming,t3_1pthfk1,False,
nvhjbeo,"1. In C/C++, arguments passed into functions **get copied** into the function. They get copied because we may not want to modify the original argument, so it saves us a line of copying, separates areas of concern, and it's a bit faster.2. We **can** pass large values (complex structs, arrays, etc...) as function arguments. But they will be copied. That can be a lot of copying, especially if we can't anticipate the size of arguments `my_func(int arg[12])` vs `my_func(int arg[9999])`. 3. Since function arguments get copied, and large copies are expensive, it's cheaper and faster to pass the address (pointer) of the data as a function argument.1. Very low level programming can involve jumping forward and backward to memory addresses. We can do math on the pointer itself to get to different addresses. You may never do this yourself, but pointers gives us access to this capability.Why are you experiencing this in C++ when C++ is supposed to be modern? Because C++ was designed to be compatible with C and the preexisting C libraries. C was designed like this because it was one of the first successful abstractions above assembly and written in an era when compute, storage, and memory was very expensive (cost and compute cycles).Edit: I mostly mentioned functions + pointers and not pointers in general, but my goal is to justify the utility of pointers and mentioning their benefits with functions is good enough.",boobbbers,2025-12-23 03:44:51,11,learnprogramming,t3_1pthfk1,False,

nvh8gsp,"Dynamic memory allocation, mostly. If you need to load a picture into memory, you don't know where in memory that picture is going to end up, so it isn't given an address until it is made. The pointer stores where that memory is after it is allocated.The next question as to why this is a thing where it isn't in other languages is because C++ is code that is running much closer to the processor than in other languages. Other languages abstract away this issue for you, but in environments where C++ is commonly used, such as 3D engines, operating system kernels, or embedded devices like arduino, we can't trust any other tooling to handle this efficiently enough for us, we need direct control. And using pointers to manage memory allocation and passing around information is how it all works under the hood.Beyond that, pointers are also the mechanism that your program uses to point to functions in other programs such as system API's, etc.",shadow-battle-crab,2025-12-23 02:36:57,7,learnprogramming,t3_1pthfk1,False,

One of the best pieces of advice I got from my first manager was something along the lines of “I don’t care about dev. We have it for a reason and no one depends on that data. Go break it. That’s how you find out how it’s working and how you find issues. We can always redeploy dev “. And that changed my learning perspective. Instead of feeling like I need to understand the docs cover to cover, I now feel empowered to take a look at the architecture and app dependencies and then just go fuck with it. For example, the past 3 years I’ve worked almost exclusively with serverless architecture in AWS using python. But I just joined a new team and we are shifting the application to EKS using a Java library. No fucking clue but I spend the last 2 days reviewing architecture, in the console, and googling/gpt every step of the way when I run into something I don’t know.

Mindlessly asking AI to generate code for you teaches you nothing. But using AI to explain documentation, recommend improvements, provide examples, and break down code can be immensely valuable. There's nothing wrong with asking AI to clarify and teach. That's exactly what a professor does; to accommodate curriculum reading.What I'll do when trying to pick a new project I'd like to do and ask it something like this: ""I'd like to make an app or program that does xyz. What stack would you recommend and why?"" It'll spit back a bunch of recommendations. Then I'll pull up Google and read a bit about them and pick one. Then I'll pop open the documentation and ask the AI: ""Let's start from the beginning. How do I render zyx? Or how do I get a basic function abc working?"" Then I might ask it to explain the code and reference the documentation. I'll sometimes ask it for a list of the most common functions from the API and what they do, etc... but once AI helps me get the ball rolling I gradually transition to doing things myself. Once I understand the code the AI generated I'll apply it myself. This approach can take awhile but has gotten pretty functional at learning new skills.

nvk9jma,"Other than ""which language do I learn"" this is the most common programming question. The answer is to build projects and start small. Look, there's no way to just leap from tutorials to building complex software in one bound. So, start small. First, choose a project with a tight scope, like a Todo app with user accounts. Then, get a Trello account and start writing out individual tasks. You want to make these tasks super simple at first. One might be ""create a webpage with Ultimate Todo List as the title."" Your next task might be ""Create a CSS Page and make sure it's linked to the webpage."" Then do the same with JavaScript.If you run into something you don't know how to do, make a card for learning how to do it. You do not need or want to fully master new technologies at this stage. You want to learn the bare minimum to incorporate it into your project.If you get stuck, try to look up the specific thing you want to do. For example, if you're trying to make a checkbox the user can click, look up that specific thing. If you're unsure how to store your list of items, look that up, but not until you're working on that task.And then you just keep going. Try to complete one or two cards per day. This is almost exactly how professional software is built, btw. Only we break the cards into batches we can complete in two weeks and call it a sprint. Remember, the cards aren't complete features, they are small tasks. If you know Git (and you should) make a repo for your project and get in the habit of making a branch for each card. Once you complete a card, merge your branch into main and start the process again. Your Main branch should always be a working app with whatever features you've added so far. Start small, complete one or two small tasks every day, rinse, repeat.It's not just a way, it's the only way.

nuwc75o,"I was in the same position a few years ago and was looking at General Assembly, but I wasn't willing to go into debt. I was signed up to NuCamp's newsletter and got an email that my city was offering a retraining scholarship, which meant I'd only have to pay $600 for 7 months of classes. Hard to pass that up.I did NuCamp from September 2024 to March 2025. It's designed to be a part-time program that you can do while you have a full-time job, but I'm not sure how realistic that is. I quit my job and went all in when we started React. Before the BootCamp, I was in tutorial hell, having done Free Code Camp, Harvard CS50, Odin Project, YouTube, and Udemy classes. I'll say that even with all that prep, the BootCamp was a firehose of information, and by the end of it, I was exhausted. I liked the classes. Most of the teachers I had were good. The Jobs class they offered was total trash IMO, but that could have been because of the teacher, who felt more like a social media influencer. That class did force me to finish my portfolio website, so it wasn't all bad. Their Discord is actively shouting out jobs. I ended up taking a few more months after class to wrap my head around React and get better at JavaScript by building projects and doing CodeWars. Over a year after starting, I'm now studying Front End Dev questions I pulled from GreatFrontEnd and dabbling with LeetCode, which has been incredibly frustrating. At best, I've probably got another six months of practice and projects before I'd be hireable, but realistically, I'm thinking I've got another year. I'm an artist, so this stuff comes slowly to me. Since you're already doing analytics, I'm guessing it will be faster for you.If you do the BootCamp, my advice is to do personal projects with people in your cohort. That was probably the MOST beneficial part of the BootCamp. Looking at my group's code and trying to make everything work together really forced me to understand it and broke me out of tutorial hell.Another tip I'd give is to grab a BootCamp class off of Udemy when it's discounted and work your way through it to see how you do.

But I can try my best to make it so that at each intersection (at each function), it is obvious which way to go. I can make it so that they do not need to spend time looking around, exploring, reasoning, guessing, and backtracking. A good function is understandable immediately, either:- accomplishing something simple in relatively few lines of code- or listing a series of other functions (each doing a simple thing in relatively few lines of code) like a recipe in relatively few lines of code.There are no points for being clever or obscuring what your code is doing. Boring, obvious code is good code.There are certainly times where it makes sense/is easier to just have a big long method.But I have found no predictor for how many bugs a function will produce more accurate than its length.

nuxcoe4,"There are several different criteria.First, is it central to your product and a critical part of what makes it a success, or is it peripheral? If you're building a calendar or scheduling app where the primary goal of the app was to schedule things, then rolling your own might be worth it to deliver an amazing experience and have full control over it. If it's just one tiny feature, it probably makes more sense to use a good existing library.Second, what are the costs of using an external component? Let's say I need a matrix multiply function. Adding a dependency on a huge linear algebra package like BLAS or numpy might increase the size of the build, add a new license to check, and just overall add a lot of complexity to the project. If the only thing I need it for is to multiply some small matrices and performance doesn't matter, I might implement it myself and use another library to verify that my implementation is correct.Last, is this something that needs to change/update frequently or is it stable? If it's parsing a data file that's internal to my project and not user-generated, then that code might not ever need to change. Writing some custom code to parse it might be fine because it's not likely to break. On the other hand if it's parsing user-generated PDFs, a third-party library probably keeps getting new bug fixes and improvements over time, so it's probably way better to use a library.",dmazzoni,2025-12-19 20:53:58,18,learnprogramming,t3_1pqvo5p,False,
nuxg0eo,"tl;dr: if I need something extremely complex and nothing matches my specific use case, or I need something very simple that I feel like will take longer to find, import, and localize.A long time ago when I was working on an ERP system, we needed a way to display tables, needed something to take a data set and do obvious things, like show data in cells, sort, filter, and paginate. But we also had a ton of niche cases and requirements. Sometimes management wanted a summary of the table, and it may need to sum, average, or count the number of times a certain value (or range) appeared in a column.Some cells also needed to provide a link, multiple links, or color-code text in some way. Some cells needed to reformat data in a certain way - for example, if we got a timestamp, did we need to show just the date, just the time, seconds since time, etc. One manager always wanted us to separate date and time as two separate columns for Excel reasons. Oh, yeah, and it needed to have a one-click download CSV export of the data in-browser (so, it couldn't re-send the data to the server to generate a file).Wrote one, it worked great, used it for about 8+ years and it got copied to several of our different systems. Eventually one of the juniors asked why we were using my library, and not some npm library he found that did ""the same thing but better"". My answer, after looking at the library, was that I wrote mine 4 or so years before the npm library was created according to its github history. It also didn't support all of the features, or at least not in some of the specific use cases we had. So it *wasn't* something that existed when I needed it, and it also still didn't technically do everything we needed it to do.Similarly, I'll also ""engineer"" extremely simple things from scratch if I feel like it would take me longer to find a library to do the thing than it would to write. This case was we had a dashboard for a monitoring tool that just needed to show groups of ""top 10s"", so 10 rows, each containing a bar, another bar (with a definable color) inside of it with width based on a percentage, and a text value (that could also be a link).

Not from the comfort of your room, but in the office while you work for example. You won't pull headphones to watch any videos there.

Their main YT channel also has several long video tutorials and crash-courses to my knowledge.There is also lots of videos all over YouTube about most programming topics / concepts, computer science, as well as specific tutorials on projects.Second, unfortunately, reading is just a part of programming as I am sure you're aware. You're going to have to read requirements of projects and their documentation, as well as write it. You're going to have to read code and genuinely try to understand it, both the functions and the larger whole. You're going to have to read documentation of the programming languages, tools, and APIs you're using.I'm not saying that to shame you, God knows, I barely read books. But reading is very much a part of programming, from the learning to the actual process of doing.Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp are both what I have experience with. They're both solid platforms, and I'd probably complete FCC first, and then circle back to Odin Project and see about the gaps and more advanced knowledge it covers. One of the big advantages is that it is fairly unguided and gives you a set of objectives to complete. This forces you to think about what you're doing, how and why, as well as forcing you to acquire knowledge and documentation just like you would on any real project.At that point, I'd probably just try making projects. Maybe dabble in a game engine like Godot because of its lightweight nature, GDScript which is very easy to read and write, and ability to do web exports for Itch.IO. Hell you can even use it to make applications / tools, not games, but I digress.I'm just not sure what to suggest that can fulfill that video requirement, besides trying a hybrid approach. Try to at least read the highlights and general idea of a topic, and then look for some videos about it, maybe practical examples. Don't force yourself to deathmarch paragraph after paragraph, but I don't know if you can truly avoid reading either.I'm sure others know more, I mostly learned by messing around modding games, reading books, nibbling on these tutorial sites and such.

nvg7hnk,"You have to understand some programming history to understand why C and C++ exist.Lets roll back the clock to 1990 or so. Personal computers are just starting to become practical. For $3000 in todays money you can get a home desktop computer about as powerful as a super Nintendo is (286 or 386 PC running windows 3.1) At the time this is considered cutting edge, way faster than those atari and apple 2 computers people are using before. You can get real work done with these!Your options for programming languages really boil down to something like assembler, BASIC, or C / C++. Lets compare each.\- Anyone programming in 1980 to 1990 or so to do real work was likely using assembler. This is as close as you can get to actual processor instructions. Read value from memory address one into register 1, read value into memory address 2, compare the values with binary math, if they are equal then JMP to subroutine that outputs string from memory address 3, etc. This is literal processor instructions - it doesn't get any more raw and fast than that.\- You could learn BASIC, but BASIC is an interpreted language. Rather than the code being compiled into processor instructions BASIC is a program itself that reads the program you are running and figures out what it should be doing in real time. This makes it about 10 times slower. But good god, is it easier to write a program in BASIC than Assembler - you can just define an array, you can just write a function, you can just define subroutines that take actual arguments - its so much more clean. If you can write your program in BASIC it will be much easier to maintain and simpler to comprehend - but its going to run soooo much slower. In a world where making a FPS like wolfenstein 3D work stretches the limit of what is possible on the hardware, a 10x speed loss is just too much when your program relies on speed.\- Then comes C and C++. The idea behind these languages is that you can write your code kind of like interpreted languages instead of assembler - defining functions, data structures, complicated mathematical algorithms - but instead of the computer interpreting the program in real time, it can convert it all to bytecode - basically the same thing as assembler - and run it almost as fast as an assembler program as a result. C/C++ is written like a processor actually acts. But as nice as this is, there are still significant shortcomings. Dynamic memory allocation which is something that just happens like magic in an interpreted language, is not automatic in C++ - stuff like creating an array, creating a variable length string, or defining a variable, or converting one variable type to another - this is not actually provided in C, you have to manage it on your own. Which you most defiantly can - and doing so is easier than doing so in assembler. So now you have all the advantages of assembler and the complexity is significantly reduced.But its not 1990 anymore, its 35 years later. Computers are hundreds if not thousands of times faster, have multiple cores, usually have 32,000 MB of RAM instead of like, 4 MB, etc. There is enough extra speed in a computer that you don't really need that extreme optimization anymore. And the way computers operate with all this extra resources have also changed - with multi core systems you can have some of the cores or the GPU handling the graphics pipeline in your program, which is like 95% of the processing time - and this is all handled outside of the program you are actually writing.There are also many, many more languages that more elegantly handle the problem of ease of development balanced against speed. Most modern languages, like javascript or python, act like interpreted languages in that they are flexible and just run, but under the hood they still compile to bytecode for speed - the performance loss of using them vs C++ is not as much as it used to be. Modern Javascript in particular is \*\*king FAST, thanks to google throwing millions and millions of dollars into optimizing chrome. The way the async cycle in javascript works is far more flexible than what C/C++ offers, and in general all the features in C/C++ are now available in newer languages, and usually they do it better.Finally, you should consider that your programs don't need the extra speed and complexity that comes with C++ because all the heavy lifting in your program will not actually be done by the program you are writing. The graphics are done by the GPU. If you want a video or mp3 encoder or something, you bring in someone else's tool into your program as a library (probably written in C++) and invoke it and get the results. Programming in 2025 is more about gluing premade tools together and orchestrating them, and your code is the orchestration layer. It is much more beneficial for this layer to be simpler and easier to comprehend and manage and leaving the dirty details to other tools.

I have b-degree in business administration, never worked in related role. 2 years ago I was 27, applied for a second university, 2 years course which teaches programming (qualification at the end). I already had bachelors degree, I didn't need 2nd one. Before the school I learned some coding already, so the course wasn't that hard and I had a bit of experience already. I only had experience with frontend, today I can build full-stack applications. (junior lvl) I got scholarship for being the best in class so that helped financially.2 years later.

Because to be real, nobody can learn advanced things in 6 months. You will only learn some simple things. You won't learn to build advanced full stack applications with best practices and high security.

nupbj6f,"The core idea of OOP is to associate data with behaviour. E.g. instead of having a `sort()` function that sorts a list of data based on an algorithm, your data has it's own `sort()` method, so it kind of sorts itself instead of getting sorted.On first glance this sounds very powerful, because a list of strings may be sorted differently than a list of numbers or a list of pointers. What OOP allows you is to have a list of any type, just call `.sort()` on it and the correct sorting method will be used automagically.This idea was then further applied to other things like a Date. Instead of using a library of functions and a collection of structs that the functions work on, you now get an object and have all functions directly associated with that object, so instead of writing `dateutils.to_string(date: Date, ...)` you now have `Date.to_string(...)`. In the early days of OOP this was used for code reuse through inheritance. Inheritance just means, that you define a new class and tell the computer that this class should have all the features of that parent class plus the new stuff you define and except the stuff you redefine in the new class.However, it turned out that Inheritance doesn't work well for code reuse, so nobody sane recommends it any more for that. It also turned out that it's more common to have different behaviour than different kind of data, so people started using ""Composition"" instead. Composition just means that your objects has other objects that are used to perform different kind of behaviour. For Example, you may have a class `Animal` and the animal is supposed to have different behaviour like walk, run, speak, eat. Instead of using Inheritance to create new subclasses of `Animal` and implement different behaviour, you define small interfaces `IRunner`, `IWalker`, `ISpeaker`, `IEater` (or similar) and write small classes for each interface. There might be a `Bark` and a `Meow` class implementing ""ISpeaker` and there may be ""BipedRunner"" and ""QuadrupedRunner"" implementing ""IRunner"" and so on. You then create different animals using the Animal-Constructor:```pycat = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Meow(), CarnivoreEater())dog = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Bark(), CarnivoreEater())horse = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Whinny(), HerbivoreEater())cat.speak() # ""meow!""dog.speak() # ""wruff!""horse.speak() # ""neigh!""```This is what ""Composition over Inheritance"" refers to. So we're almost back to having functions applied to data, but instead we call a method of an object that then looks up another object and calls one of that object's methods (for each individual method call).A big downside of OOP is that contrary to its promise it makes code harder to maintain, because you create a compile time hierarchy that matches your domain model and with that you create boundaries around things (objects) instead of creating boundaries around properties (e.g. positions, prices, ... ).

I am a music producer that posts my type beats on YouTube and Beatstars (beat selling website), and I found that uploading things is starting to become increasingly annoying as I need to click through a ton of menus and upload files and such, so I wanted to streamline that. The idea is a desktop GUI app that uses web automation to upload to Beatstars, and then Google's API for uploading to Youtube.>What I've done so far is defined Pydantic types (I'm using Python) and started work on a setup wizard screen, but I feel like feature creep is really hitting hard so I wanted to step back and plan more. Any tips?Sure, start with the most essential functionality and build outward. That would be uploading your data to one service or the other. I guess Google's API is probably better supported if not simpler, so you might wish to start by automating YouTube uploads.

Perhaps you can skip all kind of menu automation and send direct POST or PUT requests to its API, instead. Sure, menu automation and such has its place, in frontend testing and such, but first try to get it done by using the API endpoints of Beatstars. Because any and all menu clicks and dropdown selections in the end send some HTTP request to Beatstars server. Or SOAP requests or websockets or something.

But academics depend on existing curricula because it is very hard to develop new lessons and lab projects, so MIPS examples will continue for many years to come.ARM is quite popular with processors available from many different vendors. Upcoming is RISC-V and 64bit ARM (also available from Microchip). Old 8bit standbys are PIC and AtmelAVR that can be important depending on your notion of ""embedded"" (not every toaster and microwave is running Linux-ARMs yet),. There are also 16bit processors that are optimized for motor controllers if you are into that sort of thing.Once you get the hang of any one of those then the others follow pretty easily so look at the market you hope to enter. Anything with wifi or ethernet will probably want ARM or newer. Motors will be the 16bit DSP engines or specialized ARM devices (often slightly more than the typical assembly instruction set). Light bulbs and toasters and hand-held appliances will probably continue with 8bit which is easily mastered.The important point is having something to practice on until you are comfortable with how it works.

nvqjp3r,"“Assembly language” isn’t a generic thing. It’s a way to write machine code with mnemonics rather than just heaps of hex or octal numbers. The mnemonics and their meanings are entirely dependent on the machine instruction sets of the target processor. So, if you know PDP-11 assembler language, you don’t really know ARM-64 or x86 or MIPS or whatever. If you find an embedded job, you’ll be using the processor your employer chose. If you start a company to make an embedded project, you’ll choose the processor. So your core skill will be getting your coding process up and running quickly on whatever instruction set.If your time is worth anything, you’ll hammer out most of the embedded code in C. Both GCC and LLVM have really good facilities for turning C code into astonishingly well optimized machine code for your processor of choice. It can prolly generate smaller and faster code than 99.9% of programmers ever will be able to. I’ve worked with a couple of the 0.1%, those folks are amazing. But they still use a lot of C.Assembly comes into its own for small chunks of an application that are time- or power- critical. And often the assembly code is embedded in some sort of pragma directive inside .c source code files.There’s still a lot to learn by programming machine instructions directly. Learning how registers, stack pointers, program counters, and other machine concepts work is helpful. You may as well do it for whatever machine you have readily at hand. C compilers generally have options that make them generate “listings” with the generated machine instructions displayed. That, combined with the instruction architecture document for your processor, will teach you a lot.

nur1lr8,"Funny story I actually just answered a very similar question is the cs majors sub lol I will paste my answer here:First, if you want to study cs get a cs degree and then specialize after. From my experience and talking to professionals degrees like cybersecurity, information systems, and data science (do a stats major instead) are not as good.As for knowing what you want to specialize in I don't think there are any shortcuts besides trying stuff and seeing if you like it. Either take a class or build a project and see if it's cool. You can also research online about the different cs disciplines. If you decide on embedded systems I think computer or elctrical engineering is a better major, but it prob depends on the school.Regarding how economically cooked the different cs subdisciplines are, they honestly aren't that cooked. What's (or rather who) is cooked is the person who graduates, has no extracurricular experience, and is only interested in the doing bare minimum to get money.The truth is that cs isn't an easy path to 6 figures. You either need to genuinely like it or be very disciplined because the degree is only like 30-40% of the puzzle. Join tech clubs, do competitive programming/leetcode, build stuff, and give it your all! It's such a cool subject that touches all the sciences, math, and unifies it under this neat idea of very clearly describing a process.PS: Maybe it's just personal bias but it seems that web dev is the most vulnerable to AI. There's hella ai tools like replit and loveable that can already handle most basic-intermediate apps. Also if you want to be immune to ai get a job writing like cobol for a bank or visual basic for some unc company.Now specifically regarding some stuff you asked: You should stay general until you know what you like, at least until like you finish your first year or two of uni.

nvnabaf,"I find it useful here to make some distinctions because there's a lot going on if we take it apart. Key terms in bold. float arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};The **name/symbol** `arr` **aliases** the **address** (assigned by the compiler) of some **storage** (allocated somewhere at compilation time or runtime) that has a specified **value** (or values in the case of arrays) of a certain **type**. A **pointer** type is a type that stores addresses as values (pedants: yes, I've read the standard and this is good enough here). Example with address annotations in parens: float a(0x01) = 0.1f; // addr 0x01 (alias a) contains value 0.1f. float *b(0x05) = &a = 0x01; // addr 0x05 (alias b) contains value 0x01 (a's addr).Name/symbol, address, storage, type, and value, are distinct things. Names mean we don't have to write addresses (though you can, and do in embedded). Storage for a single object (not in the OOP sense, object = datum here) can of course be larger than a single address. Value is what is in that region of memory when read at a given time. Books can be written here (E.g. *Modern C*, Gustedt), this isn't supposed to be exhaustive.Answers:1. It's the address of the first byte of the first element in the array.2. Those are expressions that yield results of pointer type. Dereference and addressof operators can be thought of as inverses, yes. The reason you can write a function that takes a pointer and then pass an array is because of the language semantics, no doubt influenced by what is happening on the hardware. When passing by value in C++, the values of the arguments are copied into the target function's stack frame (usually, compilers are clever and will elide things). How do we efficiently copy an array here? We don't. We say that arrays ""decay"" to pointers in this scenario, and we copy a smaller fixed-size pointer value instead (fits in a register, nice!). Referencing the above, we've copied the (base) address of the storage of the array into the storage for the function parameter. We have a pointer value that we can dereference and/or do pointer arithmetic on. **Whereas the original name/symbol (arr) aliased the address of the first element directly, the parameter stores that same address as a value. In this situation, the language doesn't force us to explicitly take the address using an expression and then pass it, it effectively does it for us.**Hopefully that makes sense.

nvnc111,"Arrays use contiguous blocks of memory to store values. When you request an array you are requesting a block of memory that is the size of a single element multiplied by the number of elements in the array.You will get a pointer for the beginning of the block of memory. This is also the memory location of the first element in the array.You can find the memory location of any element in the array with starting location of the block, the size of each element, and the index of the element you are looking for. There is a possible out of range error that will occur if you give an index larger than you initially requested. In C and C++ it will do the math and return a memory location that you didn't reserve for the array. This is called a memory overflow and will cause a lot of difficult to find bugs.The benefit of using arrays is that it is fast at finding the data you are storing.

nvhyhws,">I have never felt so dumb and overwhelmed. I can't even solve basic array problems. I've been trying to study the patterns like sliding window and two pointer and can usually identify when to use them.For this kind of stuff, then for me it's essential to have a well-illustrated example, in order to really understand. For example, you used the term ""sliding window"", which gave my brain a vague inkling of what you're talking about, but not yet enough to have a ""picture"" in my mind of what you're really trying to solve.Then I used Google and found this Answer which is illustrated beautifully: [What is Sliding Window Algorithm? Examples? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8269916/what-is-sliding-window-algorithm-examples)Anyway, as the Answerer points out, calling it a ""sliding window algorithm"" is really a misnomer; it is a useful technique, though.So, how does one get better at using this technique? Well, you've got to practice it, of course. The example shown in that Q&A is a pretty good starter problem (find the maximum sum of n consecutive numbers); you can adapt that to almost anything (e.g. find the lowest average of n consecutive numbers, find a particular small sequence within a large stream of numbers, etc.).For this example, I'd see the ""sliding window"" approach as an optimization of the brute force approach. That is, solve it first with the ""brute force"" approach (which will still be 'efficient' in computational terms, but will be a factor of n slower than necessary), and then solve it again with a sliding window approach.Solving a problem twice may sound lame or may sound like unneeded extra work, but in a situation like this will be satisfying because first, you'll be able to measure exactly how much faster the better approach is, and second, you'll have a ""testing client"" against which you can test your 'better' approach. For something like this, it's usually easier to make a mistake in the implementation of the more clever approach, so a handy testing method is to make a testing driver that solves your problems using both approaches.(I.e. the test driver tests some sample testing inputs against the 'dumb' solution way, as well as against the 'clever' solution way) and then stops if two clients give different results (which indicates that ONE of the approaches must be wrong for that particular input). Usually you'll end up with a bug or two in the 'clever' way, but by systematically comparing with the 'dumb' way, you can normally lay such bugs to rest in a fairly straightforward way (debugging will still be work to do it, of course, but it will never feel like you're totally stuck, because you'll have the alternate version to compare against).>I've seen many people say they took courses or they learned it in college, but I just cannot afford an expensive course let alone going to college.

They all use the same Linux kernel but offer different experiences.For learning programming, don't overthink the OS choice Windows, Linux or macOs are all fine just use whatever you're using now, whatever language interests you, and dive in the OS matters more later down in your career when you have specific needs.",mellowoWorks,2025-12-21 15:06:39,4,learnprogramming,t3_1ps8789,False,

nvaqvgq,"Other people have explained the difference between an operating system and a distribution pretty well (and the distinction typically only applies to Linux - with MacOS and Windows, there is really no distinction between the concept of the operating system and the distribution).If you really want to learn about what operating systems do and how operating systems work, there is really no better way than to use Linux: with Linux, it's much easier to have access to the way that the operating system actually works and how the pieces come together, and the code of the Linux kernel is open source, so you can actually look at it if you want to. I would recommend making a USB drive with a Linux installation you can boot to if you don't already have Linux installed (Puppy Linux, MX Linux, and Slax are all good choices for this - a Linux distribution you can use from a keydrive and save your changes and files), or have a virtual system with Linux installed on it, or if you're really determined, install Linux on a partition, which can be a bit difficult to do. Another option could be to buy a Raspberry Pi, which is Linux-based, and play with that for many of your tasks.You can get books on Linux that will teach you plenty about how the operating system functions:""The Linux Programming Interface"" by Kichael Kerrisk is viewed by many as a definitive encyclopedia for understanding how Linux works. You'll learn about making system calls, OS library functions, and the relationship between applications and the kernel in detail. You'll come away from that book with a whole new appreciation as to how OSes work.""How Linux Works"" by Brian Ward. It really covers the glue that holds the OS together, covering the boot process, how the kernel manages hardware, and how networking and devices actually function under the hood.""Modern Operating Systems"" by Andrew Tanenbaum is also a great book. It's not exclusively about Linux, but it will teach you the fundamental theory of OSes, such as process management, memory, and file systems that Linux is built on.Keep in mind that you don't **need** to really understand your operating system before you can start learning a programming language. Most programming languages these days run on all operating systems (with a few exceptions). Pick the language you want to learn, and there's a very good chance it will run on whatever operating system you already have installed on your computer, and will abstract away the differences between operating systems, which is one of the main functions of a programming language: that way, programs are portable, and can be run on any operating system.",vu47,2025-12-22 01:38:59,2,learnprogramming,t3_1ps8789,False,

But other than that, the thing is stable and ""it just works"". Whereas the newest thing can have multiple open issues.Is the newest thing actually maintained? Recently I had to make a technical analysis for a new microservice and had to come up with an architecture proposal for it. I considered different alternatives. There was a library A and a library B. Library A had been around for many years. Sure, it had a lot of bloat and stuff, but it worked. Library B also seemed to work. Less bloat. Promising. BUT the maintainer/developer/owner of that library had abandoned that project. For 2 years there had been no commits. Github issues were abandoned. Yes, that B was newer than A but it was abandoned. Whereas A was older, did have more bloat, but was in active maintenance. Recent commits to update versions. Recent commits to fix vulnerabilities. etc.Is the newest thing that you should consider in the current geopolitical world? Let's say you are a developer in the US. Will you use a library made in China, in Russia, or in Iran? By itself the library can be newer and perhaps also better. BUT the decision makers can start making decisions where they tell the developers to make the library close sourced and you won't have any overview of the changes. Decision makers can introduce kill switches or backdoors. Or, the developers will collect data and send it to their data brokers. And then that data will be used in a competitive manner. One of the many reasons why one should think twice if he should use Deepseek AI, for example. Technically very promising LLM model. Also, it introduced many changes to other LLMs in the world. But, it follows the political agenda of China. It is not neutral.Does the newest thing have enough documentation? Older stuff can have massive documentation compiled by many developers over years. A new thing can have close to no documentation and you have to be one of the pioneers creating that documentation on the go.How is the new thing fitting in the existing infrastructure? Perhaps it does not even work? Yes, stuff often is meant to be backwards compatible, but not always it is the case. For example Spring Boot 2.x vs Spring Boot 3.x and different libraries. Some newer libraries expect you to use also newer Spring Boot version. Also newer Java version. You can't just throw the newest library in the code and hope that stuff works.Do you have resources (time, budget) to make upgrades to support the newest tools and the newest versions?How will you balance constant upgrades with adding new functionality and maintaining the project as a whole? A new library version can come out every month, for example. Will you concentrate on version upgrades over working what the client actually cares about? It is difficult to ""sell"" version upgrades to a client. You have to prove that it is needed. Yes, Dependabot is a thing but some time will still go into reviewing its MRs and doing smoke testing to ensure that untestable stuff (for whichever reason) works.With you updating stuff, will you break something that external service providers are using?

Unfortunately, I've seen diminishingly few video lecture series that are organized in this way (i.e. none). Sometimes, video lectures on platforms like Coursera have a limited amount of this kind of organization, e.g. ""pause the video and try to work out the solution"" type of stuff, but usually the problems presented in that kind of video situation are very simple ""fill in the blank"" or ""answer a conceptual question"" variety.TLDR: Get a textbook.",chaotic_thought,2025-12-23 05:15:05,2,learnprogramming,t3_1ptldn6,False,

You can't tackle any larger project, can't work together with others, etc. without understanding how a small part of a problem solved with code contributes towards solving a larger problem.In practical terms when you get a DSA exercises if I were you I'd just invest a little more time into planning, before doing the actual coding.- If it's more of a linear problem (you can tell if the problem reads like a sequential recipe) you can add markers or paragraph breaks where you think sub-problems start and end- if the problem description is more ""wild"" and all over the place instead of just trying to pull the problem apart through line breaks it's probably better if you create a list which on level 1 contains milestones and on level 2 contains the actual sub-tasks.

Split your code into functions, this together with proper variable names makes your code easier to understand and will lessen the need for commenting everything.

Even if problems seem similar it may show up with a different constraint and you the solution you'd normally do for that problem might no longer be effective or even feasible. Basically you get an increased scope of knowledge on top of the hindsight of knowing what approaches works well in a situation of multiple approaches being ""correct"".In the example you gave the big thing is scope. You can design and architect a website or microservice but also remember generally thats an extremely small scope and more than likely is a solved problem. Like anyone could go on some system design prep site and know how to design and architect twitter or facebook or some trading site. Where the seniority in that comes in is knowing why you may want to take some approaches vs others based on needs because you've had prior experience making such calls. Often time what you think in your head or what works on paper doesn't play out the same in reality and there tends to be a lot of edge cases that are missed.What makes the big n experience so valuable is because you get exposed to a unique scale problem. Because they work around stuff so big they get to see the extreme edge cases a little more frequently even if theyll never directly work on it but just that visibility is so valuable especially to similar sized companies. But you can turn around and see big n employees might not do well at a smaller company because the breadth of tools they need to know how to use might be something they never even have had to touch or think about previously. Or that scale isnt the big issue and theres another type of problem that needs to be solved.Like if you can crank out a business/ecom site effectively without much help or guidance (this includes truly understanding the business reasons behind what your developing) you are probably a senior at a non tech non super huge scaled company.

nvnl04i,"This is going to be a copy paste of a reply that I gave to a similar question. It’s my honest experience. No at least where I am, it’s not just a small companies thing. Here it goes:I can offer my perspective as a junior. Got a job a year before graduation.TLDR: It’s still possible to make it, but you need a degree *with* internships. If you want to guarantee yourself a job, it’s going to be *hard* work, unless you’re a genius. I’m not a genius. Caveat that I’m Canadian, the market might be better or worse where you are.More details to give you an idea: I left my previous stem degree in 2022 when I realized that it wasn’t likely to yield a stable job. I started the CS degree in 2022. I’d programmed a bit before, always liked math and it seemed like a field with a bright future. I jumped in. Things turned sour for my cohort very quickly. By late 2022, many internships were rescinded, postings on universities’ coop programs dropped dramatically, the layoffs *started*. I was pretty dismayed by this to be honest, I’d left a degree that I loved in large part for improved job prospects and now there was a very real chance that it had been a poor decision. My family and I are really not rich (lower middle class at best) so I didn’t have much a choice, I wasn’t sure what else I could do either so I decided to work *hard*. I got perfect grades, I worked on eyebrow raising side projects, I TAed a math heavy class (thanks to my previous background in my other degree), I prepped for interviews. Got my first internship in my first year of the CS degree. Had to move to a different city temporarily for it. I didn’t quite like the particular field that it was in but it was really important for my CV, I finished it and got a good review. Didn’t want to stay in the city I moved to, so I decided to find another internship. Kept doing all of the above mentioned extracurriculars and still kept my grades very high. Meanwhile, things kept deteriorating for most of my cohort, the “best” students got internships, the majority did not. Keep in mind that I’m in coop so internships are *mandatory*.Prepped harder for interviews. Got a bigger company for the second one. If my first internship taught me anything it’s that if you want to be kept on after in this job market, you better be really good. I hit the ground running at this one, lost track of the hours I put into upskilling for it. I also took classes to not put off my graduation date. By the end of the 4 months, I was shipping year end deliverables. They were pretty happy and kept me on. Salary is about 80-90k TC. Quite good for a new grad in Canada. It’s been a huge relief and I’m immensely grateful for it.End all be all, success story in adverse job market conditions, but I want to be honest with you. I haven’t had a life for the past 2 and a half years or so. It’s literally all been school and working on side projects and interview prep and TAing. Now it’s working and still going to school. My relationship blew up and I haven’t been able to date because I just don’t have time, I don’t see my friends often. My own family that I live with doesn’t even talk to me often because I’m always in my room working one way or the other, they’re understanding and supportive though.I don’t want to complain at all because this is a thousand times preferable to being poor, but I want to highlight that this is what it takes to *guarantee* yourself a job now. You have to be the best of the best, whatever best means to the job market. Most of my cohort has not gotten internships and quite a few universities are working out deals with students: decreasing the number of internships, loosening the requirements of what classes to take when, actively involving themselves in our search.

nuw8edd,"First, this requires planning beforehand. It's no good if you're figuring out what the after-hours on-call process is while the roof is on fire. As a junior engineer, you can't decide this, but you can get the conversation going. ""Hey, what happens if...?""Second, if there is no such procedure in place, then - all things being equal - I'm probably going to the concert. If it's one I could stand to miss, then maybe I'm making an offer: Cover the cost of my tickets plus something for the trouble. Something like that. But me helping you above and beyond the normal agreement is a favor, and sometimes I'm not in a position to grant you that favor. Boundaries are important.However, I'm also going to try to be accommodating within reason. In a situation like that, I'd offer to check in when I get back from the concert. If the issue's still ongoing, then perhaps some responsibility could be handed off to me so that others can get a break. This is probably really helpful as a junior, because while you might not be the best help for the initial incident, there can often be follow-up work that is less intensive. Like someone needs to run a database query every five minutes and make sure A stays less than B, until we can get the alert automation in place. And if I'm on the primary crew and I've been at it for six hours and a junior comes in at midnight and says, ""How can I help?"" you bet I'll hand that over and get some sleep.Finally, there's also the issue of Emergency Theatre. Do we really need all hands on deck? Or do we need the appearance that we're busting our butts to get it working again? There's not much you can do about this in the moment except recognize it and deal with it later. Figure out why this is the case. There's usually some failure in the management chain - some mid-level director with more power than sense, who has to be appeased. Or maybe a high-profile customer.

Even if im not getting paid more for spending extra efforts on it, I felt pleasure in the work from praises by upper management. Just getting your name recognized at the top can be a motivational aspect that turns something boring into something exciting like: ""how can i surpass myself even more next time?""For example, I worked a few years ago on a feature to create some key vault. So its a process feature, literally no programming, you could get it done in 1 hour by click click click > done. But I decided to present it on a review meeting and instead of the typical boring power point slides that engineers talk through to present their work, I decided to make it dramatic. Kinda like a thriller. I looked up articles on what happens if Secrets arent stored in a key vault. And I got a couple news articles about Uber for example or some other companies in which their credentials like API keys weren't securely stored and thus a breach happened. So basically I took these examples, added ominous bgm, and started narrating it like its a thriller movie lol. The meeting turned from boring to everyone quickly locked in. Their reactions were priceless. In the end i got all the engineers to store their credentials in the key vault. This is just one example of how you could turn something boring into something thrilling and exciting. Upper management started inviting other managers whenever they saw my name on the presenters list. They became like my fanbase ""I wonder what he has for us this time!"" Lol Personally that became my passion for a while! That has bolstered my mental outlook even if it wasnt a monetary incentive involved.

The Leetcode-focused hiring process is also antiquated and a form of gatekeeping that people in these industries use to make it difficult to replace themselves. Also, quite a bit of the tech used internally is proprietary for big tech and the working process as a whole doesn't translate well to the broader industry (most of my ex FAANG cohort has struggled to hold employment or move jobs).If you look at the state of the tech economy, big tech (or finance) and the regions that espouse it are the cultural origin point of all of the grifting.

For consistent opportunities and steady (but not great) pay, I always look at Metro regions with well diversified & stable industries that have a use for software engineers.

LLMs are a constant advancing threat to our jobs, and if that's not what ends up taking my next one, it'll just end up in India.

E.g. ""saved dev hours"" sure, but to what end? Do they actually deliver more features or does the time end up being spent on other ancillary tasks w/ same overall velocity anyways?Metrics are supposed to provide finality to an overarching story that has actual metrics, so that the narrative sounds coherent rather than an aimless rambling.

It's there because it's expected to be there if you want people to use your product.So asking me to put in metrics on my resume is pretty hard since we are implementing things on the project for the first tome and not iterating and improving something. Why did we need some feature comes down to the product owner saying this is what is needed based on conversations with X/Y/Z important person at the end of the day.There is obviously all shades of grey between the two extremes I gave as examples.

nv0a6p1,"I'm a self-taught developer who had a fairly accomplished career. I'm not working now, but I'm hoping to make my way back to it. I worked professionally for six years. I started learning C# early on in life because I loved video games and wanted to make them, there were two primary languages you could accomplish that with back then (this was about 20 years ago) C# with the XNA framework, or C++ with a library like SDL. XNA transitioned to monogame, and SDL is now SDL2. I believe Unity was around but it wasn't popular yet, unreal engine existed but the commercial license was expensive. I went with learning C# because I wanted to make games for the Xbox 360 and monogame was free to use, which I did, I launched two games before finding work in the industry doing web development. That was my path and it worked well for me.In your case, because you have a heavy math background and you're only interested in learning id try LISP or maybe Python. Those are less marketable languages but have heavier focuses on Math.Any mainstream language to start is a good one though. Game programming is fairly math intensive which you might enjoy but it's very labor intensive and requires a knack for art , if you don't mind trying to make your own graphics and aren't all that concerned about design philosophy then id still recommend C# and monogame. Maybe you could start by building pong and then transitioning to a game like tetris. Good luck!",dontdoxme33,2025-12-20 09:16:09,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1pr4334,False,

nvj53td,">I recently started looking again and even though I'm applying for entry level positions I haven't gotten even an interview yetFrankly, nothing you add to your portfolio is going to solve the ""I can't get an interview"" problem.Things in your portfolio can be useful points of reference in the absence of professional experience. That only matters if you're talking to an actual engineer, or engineering manager, who knows the difference between ""wrote HelloWorld in Rust"" and ""on the Rust board of directors"". Most HRBPs/recruiters don't know the difference, and speak ""years of accredited education"" and ""years of professional experience"" exclusively, and those are the people deciding whether your application/resume ever lands in the inbox of a manager with an open [req](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150317-00/?p=44453).Be sure to emphasize the internship and accredited education in your resume first and foremost. The portfolio, or interesting GitHub personal projects, can and should be a footnote below things recruiters/HRBPs are specifically looking for. I'll also add that tinkering alone, by yourself, on a project is not nearly as useful as collaborating with a team on a project. Because in the real world, most engineers work as a part of a team or teams to get stuff done. Consider contributing to well-known open source projects. Understand that step 0 of contributing meaningfully to most open source projects is: You understand what the project is, and who its end users are, on a deep level. That can take anywhere from days/weeks/years depending on the complexity of the project. And ""I was part of SIG release for Kuberenetes 1.31"" is easier for a recruiter/HRBP to grok than ""look at this chatbot I made, isn't it neat"". It's especially easier to grok if that recruiter/HRBP is staring at a req with the word ""Kubernetes"" in 5 different places.For extra emphasis; Fix your resume first before you spend time chasing shiny open source projects.

The last thing you need is your advisor going up for tenure and not getting it, and at least if you're in the US, that's a very real risk these days. I have a few friends from grad school who went the academic route and will be up for tenure soon, and despite playing their cards well, they're all very worried about this.So math vs CS, no real worries, but imo you are right to have reservations.",cy_kelly,2025-12-22 16:09:16,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1psugln,False,

nv7aht5,"I've had a very technical manager that did this - he was a dev on the team then transitioned to management for a few years, and then left and went back into dev work. He was a passionate engineer that was always working on one creative coding project or another outside of work though so it was probably easy to demonstrate that he hadnt left the craft behind to pm.Ive heard from others that its really difficult to go back because its hard to show that you havent lost your skills, dev mindset. From my understanding for them the difficult part hasnt been the coding challenges of the dev interviews because they stayed sharp but more like hiring managers look at them as a pm and dont want to interview them for an engineer role. So i guess it comes down to maintaining a stream/timeline of projects coding that you can use to say ""see this?
