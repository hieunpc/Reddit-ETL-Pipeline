nw805fa,"I choose for Data Engineering pretty early in my career and I'm very happy I did so.When you're a Data Scientist, one of your key goals is to extract meaning from data. You run models and try to get insights. It is very often the case though that the data either doesn't show what you would like, or it kind of does, but with pretty low certainty. Even more often the data is so bad that you couldn't really draw any conclusions from it.This puts you in a bind. You have to go explain your conclusions to the sales guys and they can't work with 'it sort of shows X, but also kind of Y'. They need to sell a product and they will. So they'll massage your conclusions in ways that you might even not agree with. Or you'll be pressured to massage the data, which I've been asked to do. I always covered my ass with emails although I luckily never needed them.As a Data Engineer on the other hand, there is no discussion. Either the data is in the required spot in the required form or it isn't. At the end of the day, your product is finished and whether or not someone can actually do anything with it downstream is not your concern. It's a very liberating feeling and it means I have barely any stress related to work.I'm not the only person I've encountered who feels similarly and I've even met a few Data Scientists who made a similar switch later in their career for similar reasons.Another saving grace is that Data Scientists are a dime in a dozen nowadays. With the AI boom everyone and their cat tried to get some certification somewhere and the quality varies wildly. Data engineering isn't as sexy and there's much fewer people in the field I have the impression.

I naturally gravitated towards technical specifications and engineering solutions. I was interested in maths, but having done some statistics courses, it wasn’t a mountain I wanted to climb.Personally I wouldn’t over think it. People swap between DS and DE all the time. A large company will probably help you transition, pay for training etc because they know there is a great deal of synergy between these teams. ie. DE’s will productionise DS models so knowing both sides isn’t a waste of time.Where I currently work, DS is seen as a ‘luxury’. They will increase headcount when times are good, and conversely, DS’s are the first people out the door when times are bad. This is because they generally work on ‘optimisations’, I guess just like how you would pause remodelling your house if you lost your job and didn’t have income coming in. DE on the other hand is much more stable. They need people to keep existing pipelines running, even if new things aren’t being built. It was how I ended up in DE, I was made redundant as a DS but told I could stay on if I switched teams. I thought I’d do this while I searched for a new DS position, but I found my proclivities more suited to DE, so never left and never thought about switching back.Generally the people who make the best DE’s have done Computer Science or Engineering degrees that involve data transfers like Telecoms.

Most of the transformation logic is SQL. Unlike say python, or a lot of proprietary solutions SQL code written today will still be good in 20 years time. There aren't any libraries to end up unmaintained. If you *really* need to you can port to another database technology and most of your transformations will port over perfectly. You might need to spin up a solution for tasks, and change your ingestion methodology, but all that business logic will be fine still.Unless you go completely open source, and want to take on board the substantial overhead with doing that, I'd say it's pretty good value.

nwds2vq,"SCD2 is built into the table schema, the code base is based on Merge or UpSert + delete tracking.I suggest you look at ""Timestamp"" column type if available on your platform, or look into MD5() function which is quite universal, to do ""hashing"" of data, and use a staging layer.When you design properly a SCD2 table in a bronze layer, and have a staging layer in a ""raw"" layer (you should always have a staging layer!) - then a SQL view with the hashed values (the PK columns, the entire data row) then SCD2 becomes a breeze to do. Breeze because you compare two tables, you have one PK column and one HashDIFF column (or TimeStamp from a source DB) that tells you easily what to do.Often it is deletion tracking the most difficult - because if you get differential data, how do you know what no longer exists in source? In such cases you need an extra pipeline logic just for delete tracking. Mentioning as this is often overlooked and it comes back to bite you at the end.For example, you load new data (from a full source or differential source) truncate/load into a staging table. Make a view to create all the extra columns you need, like using MD5() in the view. Use the staging view to do the UpSerts or Merge based on your bronze layer SCD2 historical table and the staging. For delete tracking sometimes you need a new pipeline to get a full from source but only the PK column(s), not all the columns, so the file is smaller and the process is quicker. I use a different staging table, a different pipeline, just for this. Or if you are lucky, you can get CDC from source DB and then you have 100% of all changes. If only we had this all the time.So basically you read the same data twice, the first time the data are usually files in a datalake or a file share, but it could also be a remote database that you ODBC / OleDB into to run a query. This is usually for on-prem, but I have used ODBC + MySQL remote DBs to gather info, it works really well, and no ELT/ETL tool required - it's all SQL in a stored proc.Some people create in the staging table all the extra fields to manage for SCD2 and the tool they use to consume the raw data into staging, adds the values to the extra fields, row-by-row. I do NOT like this method, as it puts intelligence inside the ELT/ETL tool making it difficult to manage. An ELT/ETL tool should be simple, just do mapping, Lift & Shift, ideally never fail - just get the data to staging table(s) and let the next level deal with issues. CSV is hell on earth, I use the BLOB technique on foreign CSV files and parse with SQL.FWIW, this topic (SCD2, 3, 4, hybrid...) is taught in actual classes world wide, maybe look into taking some basic ETL/ELT & BI courses, at least Udemy.

nwj0inp,"I think this is an inevitable consequence of the “self-service BI” fad from 2020–2022. Every vendor rode that wave, and the race became who can make it easiest to build a report, but that optimizes for a symptom, not the root problem. As more people build reports, each new question gets answered by creating yet another dashboard or a slightly different metric variant, doesn't matter which tool you use because most analytics systems are designed in this way that makes duplication almost inevitable, and it's a ticking bomb because over time the whole thing collapses under its own weight.I’ve been in both setups. In one org, I basically churned out reports on request, where speed was the currency. Stakeholders loved it and tbh it made things easier when it came time to ask for a promotion because output was highly visible. But as the organization grew, the same metrics started showing different numbers across dashboards and eventually we had to go back and pay down the debt we’d accumulated. in my current org, we do the opposite where we lock metric definitions early and invest heavily in the semantic layer. This also means we have to define business logic as code and build composable metrics early on so new questions build on existing definitions instead of spawning new dashboards, new models, and new forks of truth.

nwtian6,"Hi I work with Pydantic and dataclasses everyday and I think I can explain this well.Pydantic - mostly used when there is any input/output that needs to be validated, a good example is let's say I want to integrate with some external service, if I have to call their endpoints with any specific payload Pydantic makes sure that my outgoing data to that service will always have these fields and I can write custom rules for a Pydantic class to enforce certain conditions. Same works for if any service decides to call my endpoints, I can stop any processing to happen if request data to my endpoint is wrong.Dataclasses - used mainly for internal data transfer. An example for this is, let's say after my Pydantic validation occurs I now want to move around the fields I can set them in a dataclasses and move them around with pass by value/ reference. Now I can do this with Pydantic also but why I shouldn't. Pydantic does have an overhead when it parses the field this is very small but I've hit cases when it matters (Pydantic v2 is faster). Dataclasses are faster when I've already validated the data internal transfer is faster and makes more sense to use a dataclass when I just need to move and play around with the data. Additional point database updates I would make a data access layer which would be validated against the schema. I use SQL alchemy here for the models some people use Pydantic here too, optional honestly. This way it makes it easier to unit test too when you abstract everything and loosely coupled.

From I can tell, you definitely can, and sometimes want to, use pydantic to load in your api data. It will not only parse and validate it, but it can standardize your field naming too. You can do a lot of cool things with it, like use a TypeAdapter for places where you need different structures that come out of the same API. That being said, I do view it more as an OLTP type tool, it *feels* more row based. For DE tasks, I would reach for DuckDB or polars to read in the API or json data and flatten it.

Not a big deal for a small/solo project, but at scale it can introduce unintended changes if upstream schemas evolve (new columns, renamed columns, type changes) and can impact downstream models silently.* Your models appear to be **full refreshes** (not incremental), meaning tables are recreated on each `dbt run`.

nwe8n1x,"After doing this for literally decades I have to say I'm a complete convert to doing as much of this work upfront via Data Contracts as possible: * Data Contracts can define required vs optional columns, their types, their formats (ex: phone numbers with dashes), their min/max values, their min/max string lengths, their enumerated values, and their NULL rules. That contract can be stored in a JSON structure and shared with your upstream source - and then be the basis for their testing and yours. Nothing else will provide as much DQ guarantees as this. And it can be a simple library call to hand over a row/file/table to a utility for checking. * Anomaly-detection is also valuable to do prior to transformation: does your input always have 10 million rows and suddenly you only have 65? Regardless of whether the rows are formatted correctly, you probably have a partial file. Or how about if one of those columns is historically NULL 1% of the time, and that's ok, but now it's NULL 100% of the time. Something has changed...I like doing the above because each of these can typically work with raw data, can catch a ton of problems pre-transform, and isn't much work. Then once you get into the transforms you'll need to do more of the above, but in that case it'll be for items you couldn't check with raw data - like joins that fail because there's suddenly no matching rows, etc.",kenfar,2025-12-28 17:38:18,25,dataengineering,t3_1pxuxev,False,

I'm assuming when you say pipeline, that you are talking about a data ingestion that gets incorporated into your larger existing analytical system. That matches my experience with the schema + CSV issues you are describing.Everything looking fine on the surface but more subtle, complex assumptions about the data being broken post pipeline deployment is something I've run into often. I've had varying degrees of success in trying to proactively identify issues like this. There are a few things that worked for me, particularly when the data source is an external partner. My experience is also in smaller companies where end to end analytics is entirely my responsibility and there is limited support from other colleagues. With that in mind, this kind of validation is imo a balance between getting the pipeline into production quickly and making issue identification and maintenance as easy as possible.**Before building anything / requirements and assumption refinement:*** Get all info about the data source you can * Ask for data dictionaries and/or entity relationship diagrams -> only commonly seen these available in finance but solves 99% of these problems before they happen * Figure out all your critical assumptions and ask about them explicitly (primary keys, important relationships, etc.)* Identify key internal stakeholder(s) that have the business context to clarify expectations * Who can be your point of contact for escalating + investigating issues down the line * Identify what aspects of the data being ingested are critical to *your own* business' processes * Primary keys and most likely a subset of columns/fields rather than everything * That a field exists, is an enum of X possible options, etc. * Things that if your assumption about the data become wrong or broken, then the data becomes unusable or detrimental to the business**While building:*** Codify your critical assumptions * If these are broken pipeline FAILS -> clear alert that mentions you as pipeline owner and your internal stakeholder with a clear business-centric message * Subset of critical fields that must have some characteristics* Quarantine/identify your non-critical assumptions * Should NOT fail the pipeline so that business critical data can still flow * More of a nice to have * If a non-necessary or unused field starts breaking assumptions -> alert that mentions only you as pipeline owner with clear technical context, allows you to create a backlog task which can be prioritized appropriately There's plenty you could do to abstract and reuse a lot of this functionality in whatever your ingestion/orchestration tool you are using but personally I have been unsuccessful in advocating for this internally.I am making plenty of assumptions about the latency requirements, criticality of the data to your business, and that you have some kind of semi-mature ingestion framework with alerting capabilities. This also assumes your destination tables are pre-defined with the pipeline and you aren't using some kind of lakehouse pattern which I have less experience with.

If the data is ""invalid"" by your criteria, can you drop it on the floor? If so, maybe you can validate it at parse time.

Both are tough and have complexity in it that may not be obvious to the users of that data. A pattern I've seen that did okay was to take anything that didn't fit into our target schema, we just threw it into an additional column called `invalid`. From there we can at least write some additional SQL that looks for any records that contain something within `invalid`.At the very least this would provide you (or whoever is using your ingested data) the knowledge that _something has changed_, without knowing exactly what.

Move data through them with ETL (or ELT).-I had to model my data using the Kimble method for my curated version (dimensions and facts). It definitely helps with Power BI reporting. There are lots of resources for this online.- Consider how your API works. When you call it, what does it give you back? Is it a full data set, or do you pass it a date and it just gives you back a smaller set of data? Which columns in that API call do you need and which are definitely not useful to your business (don't get rid of them in raw in case the business wants them in future, but think about if they are needed in cleansed). I was able to use watermarks to record when the pipeline last ran. I can pass that watermark to my API so it only gives me the data that has been inserted or updated since then. That's handy because you process a much smaller data set.-Think about what happens if your pipeline fails at each stage. Draw it out on paper if you have to, think about why parts could fail and how you would fix them or deal with the next pipeline run.- Spend some time thinking how your pipeline will handle deleted data. If someone deleted a record from November in your CRM, how does it need to be handled in your reporting?

nvqigji,"In an enterprise environment you are usually not in control of the data sources. So any type of data source changes can affect your pipeline downstream. As you mentioned schema changes are common, but relatively easy to detect. Most often I experienced renaming of columns, which manifests as a missing column in your expected schema and a new column at the same time. The pipeline cannot resolve this issue and will most likely fail if the missing column is used in transformations. You can detect schema changes with DBT-tests with dbt-expectations package or you can use great expectations package or dlt (data load tool) when using Python. Those tools also allow for detecting other type of problems, e.g. for categorical fields additional values that are not expected. You can also define simple tests or expectations that a column shouldn’t have NULL values, or fields need to be of a specific types and and and …Anything you can envision will happen eventually. And most often it requires human intervention to be fixed because most likely you need to talk to other people to either fix it at the source or you need to adjust the data pipeline to handle the new case. Your time is best spend in investing in detection and observability so you can spot the reason for the failure quickly.One way to minimize your disruption (and this is used in more mature organisations) is to create data contracts with your source system owners.

Basically you shift the intellectual efforts from the raw layer to the data mart layer, but in the middle of the process you just wasted unnecessary time building the data vault, when you could have started directly on the data marts or building some bronze and silver layers, which are much more flexible and easier to maintain.Oh and i forgot to mention the pickiness of having surrogate keys everywhere, which is something that blocks any optimization from the modern sql engines of snowflake for example.",Tough-Leader-6040,2025-12-28 00:35:19,1,dataengineering,t1_nw9zpup,False,

Yes, passthrough had some limitations, but it also allowed you to mount storage without baked-in creds, rely on hyperscaler storage security model, and have multiple engines respect a single security model (think what Fabric OneLake aims to achieve today). For many of us, the model was clean, elegant and worked extremely well because it encouraged an *open* Lakehouse.While Unity Catalog solved some real governance problems, it conveniently became the ONLY path forward for a growing set of feature. There were real tradeoffs made between openness and control, and Databricks obviously chose the latter.

nwjm4j9,"Well - article style is debatable and not really my style. But I have to agree with the actual content. Newer data processing framework or libraries are simpler to use and more scalable without a cluster. THE RACE TO THE BOTTOM:The big data journey started with Hadoop and then Spark came along. Both technologies require clusters of computers with a lot of setup and maintenance. So Hadoop had it moment but mostly disappeared. It wasn’t the right technology for most of the need for enterprises, unless you are Google. Then cloud data warehouse (redshift, snowflake) became popular, but pretty quickly companies had to pay more than they wanted for pretty simple data processing in most parts. But snowflake at least offered a managed service that took away the infrastructure management away from users. A lot of companies still using snowflake for their BI needs and even analytics. Fast forward to data lakehouse architectures. Now we can do the same than in snowflake on files in s3. The clear winner out of this phase was Databricks due to their integrated approach covering end-to-end processing needs. Compared to other approaches it is simpler and managed. Cost of Databricks is cheaper than data warehouses, but we still pay a premium for compute. Now the datalakehouse evolves with on-process DBs like duckdb that offer same performance with much simpler compute for most use cases. This phase is work in progress and lead by DuckDB. But it promises lower cost at similar performance and simpler data stack compared to the 15 year old spark technology. But no end to end platform yet.Data stack is evolving. Throughout the journey performance is increasing slightly or remain the same as the price is of data processing is getting cheaper.",Hofi2010,2025-12-29 13:52:28,2,dataengineering,t3_1py3rg0,False,

nwlyiyi,"Speed and cost are local optimisations. In practice, you’re optimising total cost of ownership and organisational throughput over 5 to 10 years. That brings in other dimensions:**Standardisation and skills** Using one platform for most workloads simplifies hiring, onboarding, and design decisions. Running DuckDB *and* Databricks or Snowflake already means duplicated mental models, tooling, and operational overhead. Spark skills are also far easier to source today than DuckDB-specific expertise.**Usability across roles** A data platform isn’t just for DEs. Analysts, analytics engineers, QA, data scientists, and software engineers all need access. Most don’t want to reason about Python internals or query-level optimisation. Platforms like Databricks and Snowflake work because they provide a shared abstraction layer with escape hatches when needed.**Operations and integration** A “simple VM running DuckDB” isn’t simple in production. You still own OS patching, security hardening, monitoring, backups, scaling, incident response, and integration with IAM, logging, and alerting. That operational load is labour-intensive and expensive.**Compliance and risk management** Enterprise systems must comply with GDPR, ISO/IEC 27001, SOC2, BCBS, etc. Using a certified platform drastically reduces audit scope. Saying “the platform is ISO27001-compliant, we only audit our data logic” is far cheaper than proving compliance for bespoke VM setups.**Support and continuity** At scale, systems fail in non-obvious ways. Having access to vendor engineers who understand the internals matters. Enterprises also care about platform longevity; they expect core infrastructure investments to last 5-10 years, not depend on a small ecosystem or a few experts.Other concerns I’m deliberately not expanding on here include cost attribution, blast-radius reduction, workload isolation and concurrency control, data governance (lineage, column- and row-level security), and long-term exit costs.By the way, I think DuckDB is excellent technology, that's not really the problem here because the question isn’t whether it’s fast or cheap in isolation, but whether it minimises risk, effort, and cost at the organisational level.",sleeper_must_awaken,2025-12-29 20:45:23,3,dataengineering,t1_nwlnfmy,False,

But even then, after you have your prototype running, you should build a relational database based on your MongoDB database.I was led astray. I was one of those naive newbies. I chose MongoDB for my project. At first, I liked it: when I needed to add a field to an object, I add it in my code and it just worked. It felt like magic at first.But after a while, I found out any query more complex than a basic join is a nightmare. Unreadable mess. Absolute degeneracy. My code was full of 100+ lines long unreadable queries decorated with comments like // no way in hell this is the correct way to write this, but it works so DON'T TOUCH ITI thought ""surely I am missing something. Surely there's a way to write the queries more nicely. Surely with more practice, it will get more readable"". But after a while, I realized this was not happening.And the indexing. If you don't have properly set up indexes, the costs skyrocket. And you don't get any sort of warning that the database is manually searching through the millions of entries, checking them one by one for a match, multiple times per query. And even if you have indexes that by all means should have been used, sometimes they just don't get used, without any apparent reason. Optimizing queries is hell.At one point, I had to bite the bullet. I knew I could not keep it at this state much longer. It took me 2 months of tedious work, rewriting everything to Postgres, migrating all the data that accumulated over time. It sucked. But the relief of finally deleting the wasteland that my MongoDB has become was like getting that really bad tooth that has been decaying for 5 years finally pulled. It was awesome.Just use Postgres. If you are working with data of undefined structure, just use JSONB.And to show you a concrete example, here's a query from my codebase back when it used MongoDB (yes, all this is a single query).

If I have complete control over my object model, I would always use a relationship database since I’m already familiar with SQL. Also, if I have a lot of data to process (like GBs or TBs), I’ll avoid MongoDB or any NoSQL database.3. It's usually a great choice.

I will say that it scales very well; a cluster of Mongo instances is very malleable, instances can be added, removed and scaled at will without any downtime. Also, since it's schemaless, there's hardly ever any downtime for anything like schema migrations or the like.This comes at quite a cost though. You need to _really_ understand its eventually-consistent model to write code that may be prone to race conditions, where you'd just use locks and/or transactions in other databases. You'll also need to understand its failure modes in edge cases; for example how _exactly_ the retry behaviour of the driver is in case a server instance happens to disappear mid-transaction, and when the application needs to catch that and retry itself.Even if it's schemaless, for most regular applications, you still need a schema.

nwccx3s,"My opinion alone: There is a mindset shift that hasn't happened yet in your brain.Learning to write isn't the same as learning to express yourself. I can teach a toddler to write letters, doesn't mean the toddler can write words. And it doesn't mean the toddler can write a syntactically right and meaningful sentence.Writing is easy. You just put letters one after another. Learning the words is harder, you have to know the words. Making a meaningful sentence is very hard.It requires you to have an idea to express, then choose the right words, in the right orders, with the right nuances to get your listener to understand you.This is all about code here. Learning ""for"", ""if"", ""while"", ""switch"", ""function"", ""null""... All those keywords that have a specific meaning. You know most of them.I guess that if I asked you to write a loop over an array you could achieve it. The issue comes with complexity.You don't know what to express and even if you know what to express, you aren't experienced enough to know how to express it if the complexity rises.From my point of view, if my take makes sense to you, you'll have to work through that. It took me 2 years to get that mindset. It takes more or less time for different people depending on where they start and how efficient their learning process is. You need more time, more practice.Make projects, complex ones. Do some more DSA. Work the problems in your brain, try your solution on the computer, get the result, fix and restart the process. Look on the internet for information and solutions, but don't copy directly, understand and inject the solution in your code, try it, see it, feel it, deeply.On another note: feeling dumber than you thought. I don't think you are stupid, but I don't know you. It's relative to what you think and expect here. I think you just had a revelation on the Dunning Kruger effect. Feels like science, not sure it is, but the intuition is pretty on point IMO. The less experienced in something, the more confident you are in it. You hit the reality check.

New things happen, assumptions on what is important might change, and you need a cycle to manage this reality. Waterfall strategy only works short term, agile strategy is what separates success stories from failures long term.

Well, bash and linux scripting, javascript (specifically async), sql (on the administration and optimization side), and react state as a design pattern I feel are all key.

nwnncea,"source: Professional Programmer since 1990Here are some skills which, in my experience, help keep people in demand. These are all skills one can learn, hone and master if you want.6. Learn the basics. Understand how computers works, how software works. For instance, what is actually happening when a line of code calls an api function and gets a result? Become familiar with general architectural principles/patterns to help know when to apply what, and to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different tools and frameworks. For instance, understand why certain architectures, languages and frameworks exist, and their pros/cons. Why does C matter in some cases, while in others Python or R might be a better choice? When should you use third-party libraries and frameworks, and when should you not take on extra dependencies? This leads to the next item. 5. Moving comfortably between deep debugging and a wider perspective and knowing when to dive in, when to zoom out, and how to switch quickly between the two.6. Scoping problems quickly. Recognising when you have enough information to act, and when you need to pause and go andlearn more.1. Be good at delivery. Being able to get things done and helping manage your work well. If people can trust you to get things done, they are more likely to want you on their team. Everyone takes time to get better at estimation. Practice getting better by reflecting on why sometimes things took longer/shorter and where you might need to plan better. 2. Knowing when to move fast and accept trade-offs, and when to slow down and lift quality. Knowing to trade off quality, reliability, (all the 'ilities') etc 2. Always be learning. Stay curious about new ideas and whether they make things better or worse. Spending regular time getting hands-on with new technology, techniques, processes and engineering practices matters. There is endless information out there, so be selective, but genuinely interested. Whatever your preferred medium for learning is, make sure you get a good spectrum of quality info3. Being able to step out of the code and talk to senior leaders about risks, benefits and costs. This means understanding the bigger picture well enough to help them make decisions that affect the organisation, without getting lost in detail. You have to be genuinely interested in their problems to really understand them. They will appreciate it generally.4. Bringing technical and non-technical people together to solve problems, both day to day and long term. Knowing who to involve and when is a very great skill. This can be applied whether you're in an org or working in your business for others 7. Being a heavyweight engineer. Someone with N years of deep experience and judgement, not the same year repeated N times.8. Be good at spotting trends and patterns early and calling them out so plans can be adjusted in time. This applies at every level, from yourself and peers, all the way to the big bosses.9. Being a decent person. Don't be the twat that thinks they know everything and treats others with disdain. Even if you do know more, you should treat people with respect. Some will be dicks who don't return the favour, but most people I've found just want to do good work and get on in lif. If you treat them with decency, they are far more likely to help you achieve your goals. 10. Be a producer. Most people are consumers of stuff. If you go out of your way to be a producer. This could be as simple as taking time to share your knowledge with others, or even speaking up in discussions, even to ask questions. You'll be more noticed and more likely to be in their mind when people want to get something done. Often this leads directly to getting better work and with it more impactful rewards. This is a bit of a haphazard list. And you'll see that I've not listed any particular tech. It took me a long time to transition from being quiet and technical to being more interested in the bigger picture and interacting with others more. I really wish I had this list when I was a junior.

What ends up happening for me is that I go with the simplest solution and just run with it. If we find value in increasing performance or reducing resource usage, then we spend time doing that. Otherwise, get the functionality out and get feedback ASAP. There's no point spending a week to reduce cost & complexity when the client is gonna say no to the entire functionality anyways. This isn't to say it's not important and you should skip it though. It is important, and not knowing it will be detrimental towards your progress imho.

nvtws9f,"Well it appears that your head isn't screwed on right. So settle down and reboot your mind. Here are some suggestions.1. At this point I consider it to be absolutely stupid to introduce CS to students with IDE's. To much basic material gets glossed over that often results in students not understanding what is happening underneath.2. Frankly this applies to trying to write any software as a GUI application, there is too much to learn to be distracted by GUI's.3. So what we need to do is to get back to basics.4. This means building software with command line tools and maybe a simple GUI text editor. 5. I'd suggest following a CS program that uses C++. You already supposedly have some CS under your belt but I'm really wondering if you learned anything. But the point here is that as each point is explored in class you just write code that leverages that technique in as many ways as possible. The usual first program is to write your name to the screen, often followed by simple looping. Explore looping for hours then continue with every other concept discussed in the program. the idea is to totally understand the ins and outs of every concept and be able to use with muscle memory. 6. Then start writing simple command line programs that solve things you understand well. Try to tie in these programs with hobby's or other thigns you know well. The point is you understand the the technology so you know what is right and you know the end result you want to see. An example would be writing a program that takes resistor band colors and returns the actually resistance value. Another example would be to display your favorite Chili receipt on screen. The idea is to start out dirt simple and grow from there.7. Once you fell comfortable building command line programs from abstract requirements then start building GUI apps. At this point you will likely want to shift away from C++ to a common platform programming language. For example on Apples systems that would be Swift. In some ways you will be starting over as Hello World is a common first GUI program. You will also need to become familiar with more advanced data structures and methods.8. Once you get past the introductory step you need to start crafting your own apps while you follow a platform specific program. Again the idea here is to take something you understand well, a hobby or something other and create programs that solve a problem within that domain. You can even start over with a receipt program but this time one that stores multiple receipts and allows more interaction. The idea is to get more and more complex. As you learn more and more you will realize just how bad the first receipt program was and can refactor it as much as possible.

nwlnmze,"The best source for learning OOP is learning Smalltalk. Squeak is a modern Windows implementation. Don't go crazy learning the language like you're going to make a career of it - if you're fast at picking up syntax, you'll probably do the most learning in just a few hours. Smalltalk is a single-paradigm, OOP language. It is **THE** OOP language most modern OOP has derived from.The principles of OOP are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism; but these principles (idioms) don't *MAKE* OOP, they each exist in nearly every other programming paradigm - imperative programming has all of these idioms. These principles *FALL OUT* of OOP as a natural consequence.OOP is the paradigm of message passing. I don't move your arms for you - nor do I COMMAND you to open your umbrella, I just have to tell you it's raining. You have autonomy and agency to do whatever is appropriate in response. You could ignore me, you could open your umbrella, you could tell me to buzz off, you could call the police.Objects are a black box that can send and receive messages. In C++, standard streams are the de facto message passing interface, and you have to integrate some of it's interfaces into your implementation - for us, we have implementation level control over the details. In Smalltalk, message passing is a language level feature built right in, which is convenient, which was conventional for the 50s and 60s, but Bjarne took certain issue with that - hence he made C++ the way it is.An object is implemented in terms of state and functions. Your state is typically member fields and objects. Encapsulation *isn't* about tightly coupling functions with **DATA**, it's about classes modeling behaviors by enforcing invariants in member state. Data is bulky and dumb - data doesn't DO stuff. State is an implementation detail. A car has an engine, and so the throttle has to pass a message to the carburetor to accelerate. An engine has an RPM, which is just a number. In C++, you'd mix these types and concepts, in Smalltalk even numbers are objects.Smalltalk is very dynamic and has no type safety. You can ask an integer to capitalize itself; at runtime, it can either ignore the message, or respond with a `:dontknowmessage`, or defer to an exception handler. C++ allows for type safety - another reason Bjarne invented C++, but there's a fair amount of syntax to go with it.Very few multi-paradigm languages get OOP correct. The 1990s were TERRIBLE for OOP. Eternal September came in 1993 - when more people entered comp-sci than the industry as a whole could absorb and mentor them; OOP was oversimplified to the point of being wrong, but the egotistical blind were confidently leading the blind, who couldn't have known better.As a result, you get ""C with Classes"", which is what I'd call most all of it - even in Python. It's actually a strictly imperative style that doesn't have an OOP bone in its body. Getters and setters are a consequence of the C type system, and are often seen in frameworks - but if you're not writing in C, if you're not writing a framework, they're an anti-pattern. Classes model behaviors and enforce invariants - a car can accelerate, turn, stop and start... They can't get make, get model, get year. The car doesn't use those properties to implement it's behavior. Those properties can be associated with the car in a map or table.There are many kinds of polymorphism, and late binding (virtual functions) are just one of them. Javascript has this in spades since you can just ASSIGN additional functions to instances - they are not strictly bound to a prototype. There are several kinds of static and dynamic polymorphisms - function overloading, type erasure, multi-dispatch, overlapping types, indirection...Then inheritance principally models IS-A aggregation or HAS-A composition. There are other types, like C++ has LIKE-A. While neat, inheritance is often misunderstood and misapplied - for everything you might think you want to use it for, presume you're wrong, first.---If you want a book on the subject, the seminal tome is `A Theory of Objects (Monographs in Computer Science)`. Good luck meeting anyone who has ever heard of it, let alone read it. When I tell you you'll likely never meet a developer who has the first clue what OOP is, I mean it. This is our industry's singularly biggest Dunning-Kruger.Note that Java has no de facto message passing interface. Not like Smalltalk. Not like C++. Many languages, like ECMAScript, Java, and C# are so fundamentally wrong about OOP they'll tell you that function calls ARE message passing. Absolutely insane.

You'll be told that OOP is: public class car { private int speed; public int getSpeed() { return speed; } public void setSpeed(int speed) { this.speed = speed; } }And this is wrong. But everyone SAYS this is right. There is nothing OOP about this code whatsoever. The principles don't make the paradigm, the paradigm makes the principles. In Java, you need to make messages and a mechanism for passing them between objects.You can create objects in Java, but Java isn't inherently Object Oriented. Having objects isn't enough. Fuckin' C has objects - it's explicitly in the language standard, but no one thinks of C as Object Oriented.I want you to have a chance of understanding what OOP is.You won't understand OOP until you study Smalltalk and original materials from the OOP era before the late 90s disaster.

Each day you’re given a Christmas themed puzzle to solve and some input data and you have to write a code to solve it in a language of your choice. The puzzles get progressively harder as you go. The first few days are usually fairly simple list comprehension style but as you get further you have to use DFS, regexes, Dijkstras, interpreting JSONs etc. So it’s a fun way to practice DSA with a bit more of a story than Leetcode. As an example one of the puzzles from 2024 you’re given input data which is a large grid of #’s and .s plus one ^ . The ^ is the start postion of a guard. The guard walks in the direction she’s pointing until she hits an # when she turns right. You have to work out how many unique cells the guard visits before leaving the room.The challenge goes back to 2015 and you can play all of the old puzzles for free so I find it a really fun way to practice.

But academics depend on existing curricula because it is very hard to develop new lessons and lab projects, so MIPS examples will continue for many years to come.ARM is quite popular with processors available from many different vendors. Upcoming is RISC-V and 64bit ARM (also available from Microchip). Old 8bit standbys are PIC and AtmelAVR that can be important depending on your notion of ""embedded"" (not every toaster and microwave is running Linux-ARMs yet),. There are also 16bit processors that are optimized for motor controllers if you are into that sort of thing.Once you get the hang of any one of those then the others follow pretty easily so look at the market you hope to enter. Anything with wifi or ethernet will probably want ARM or newer. Motors will be the 16bit DSP engines or specialized ARM devices (often slightly more than the typical assembly instruction set). Light bulbs and toasters and hand-held appliances will probably continue with 8bit which is easily mastered.The important point is having something to practice on until you are comfortable with how it works.

nvqjp3r,"“Assembly language” isn’t a generic thing. It’s a way to write machine code with mnemonics rather than just heaps of hex or octal numbers. The mnemonics and their meanings are entirely dependent on the machine instruction sets of the target processor. So, if you know PDP-11 assembler language, you don’t really know ARM-64 or x86 or MIPS or whatever. If you find an embedded job, you’ll be using the processor your employer chose. If you start a company to make an embedded project, you’ll choose the processor. So your core skill will be getting your coding process up and running quickly on whatever instruction set.If your time is worth anything, you’ll hammer out most of the embedded code in C. Both GCC and LLVM have really good facilities for turning C code into astonishingly well optimized machine code for your processor of choice. It can prolly generate smaller and faster code than 99.9% of programmers ever will be able to. I’ve worked with a couple of the 0.1%, those folks are amazing. But they still use a lot of C.Assembly comes into its own for small chunks of an application that are time- or power- critical. And often the assembly code is embedded in some sort of pragma directive inside .c source code files.There’s still a lot to learn by programming machine instructions directly. Learning how registers, stack pointers, program counters, and other machine concepts work is helpful. You may as well do it for whatever machine you have readily at hand. C compilers generally have options that make them generate “listings” with the generated machine instructions displayed. That, combined with the instruction architecture document for your processor, will teach you a lot. Especially, compare the generated code with optimization turned off (-g) and on (-O).",Aggressive_Ad_5454,2025-12-24 16:20:09,-2,learnprogramming,t3_1pup6ow,False,

We can throw at you all kinds of tech stacks but what if you pick DevOps over web application development? Or you pick mobile app development over IoT/embedded programming? Perhaps you go for telecom technologies instead?You having finished your first semester is a bit early to make you pick a path and target one or another company. Unless you clearly know what you want to do.Also, your break is going to be what, 1 month or less? It will not be enough to go over all the different paths one might recommend to you.I'd say that if you haven't done yet, then learn to use Git. It will be used regardless in which field you'll be working at. Learn to make pull/merge requests, learn to make feature branches, etc. That knowledge will be needed also in your coming semesters. Try it out with some hobby project (whichever medium: mobile app, a script outputting to a terminal, a website, etc.)Then, you do can map the different technologies that are used by companies in your area. Search by ""junior developer"" or ""junior engineer"" or ""junior software developer"" or such. Yes, you are targeting internship but you'll be working with some tech stack. Even when it comes to very simple tasks they give to interns. You can make a list for mobile app development, a list for web application development, a list for IoT/embedded/hardware programming, etc. Might be that some of the technologies you will learn during your courses. But definitely can be that you might have to learn something on your own or they will teach you during the internship.Another thing that you can do is mapping down all the different companies that are taking interns in first place. You can learn all the different programming languages, but when you have no company to apply to then perhaps you are picking a technology that has no internships in your area. For example you might be learning Python or Java but if companies in your area are taking only interns to embedded programming then you'll need C and C++ instead. So, make a solid plan first before you start picking programming languages, frameworks, etc.You can also look into companies that are hosting open door days, hosting tech talks, etc. Yes, these are not internship events but if you are social enough, you might find internship via connections you make in these events.More realistic approach (instead of looking for internship via tech talk events) is looking if your university has a programming/robotics club. And then join that. These clubs will introduce you into different interesting projects, into different club organized events (but also company visits), and you'll get connections.This is what you realistically can do during your break. You'll have much clearer idea of your options when you start actually applying for internships. Whereas your course mates will be in your current shoes, looking aimlessly for internship offers, not knowing what to do.Sure, it helps if you have a hobby project and you have it in Github and perhaps even hosted somewhere or running on some device (depending of its nature). Then a company will see that you can actually work on a project.Besides an ability to work on a project you also should improve your group work skills / soft skills. This is why I suggested to join some programming related extracurricular activity club in your university. Software development is a group work, usually. Yeah, there is freelancing but you are not targeting it as an intern. An intern must be able to work in a team. I have had different bad experiences with new hires who just do not function in a team. Sure, you can have all kinds of technical skills but if you do not function in a team then it will harm your own progress, it will make you a blocker when it comes to handling tasks, etc. A good intern is somebody who is proactive, shows an interest towards learning, is willing to work in a team, is a good listener, etc.",mandzeete,2025-12-27 00:05:19,7,learnprogramming,t3_1pwhyk8,False,

Hell, I didn't even start a votech until 25.One thing I can suggest to you is to take a step back from programing, and use something like [draw.io](http://draw.io) to map everything out. It doesn't have to be perfect, but you can get a good idea of what's where. Then the implementation is going to be easier, and you can see right off the bat what you can trim. It's also a good exercise in mapping out your edge cases. When you are building something that moves and interacts with the world your primary focus is on not missing a single edge case because people can be hurt and property can be destroyed. Ya dig? Your project isn't likely there yet.I keep several things. A note book, my phone, a couple docs. Then when I'm going through stuff, I make sure I didn't miss these edge cases I noted down everywhere. I generally deal with industrial systems, particularly utilities like ammonia refrigeration, steam boilers, large electrical power systems, large pump systems, etc. So it's not as important for you.Once you have a solid map and the data laid out, what you can/can't do will make more sense I'm sure.

In a new city, they have safety drivers go down each block to do the initial mapping. They also have GPS as backup, and for Google, Streetview as another backup for 3D AR mapping. Your little bot does NOT have any of these secondary / tertiary locator means in the school interior. So you can be inspired by Google / Waymo, but you cannot copy their approach because you don't have their hardware nor their secondary / tertiary nav data.

Learning C is kinda like that, you're learning skills that most programmers never bothered to learn, skills which are highly desirable to managers if they know them.So my advice is keep learning C and keep progressing.

Is the zip code column in the database an integer rather than a text string? Did the user interface where somebody enters my service address or billing address strip the leading zero from the zip code before storing it, because it treated it as an integer?

nwr6atc,I'm an engineer with a physics background and I'm currently a professional Haskell developer.There's this common trope that software engineers want to retire to become farmers after a few years in the business. I don't feel that way after almost ten years as a professional dev.I think it's because the imperative nature of most mainstream languages will have you rewriting the same for loops over and over again. Object oriented programming promised that you could reuse code but that never really paid off and so a lot of people are feeling disillusioned with the promises of programming.I think Haskell gives you a much better way of actually reusing code. The way it does it is by using algebra on the type level. I very much enjoy the process of figuring out the types first and then the implementation often comes naturally from that. It's much closer to math or pure logic than imperative programming.I haven't tried too many other functional languages so I can't speak for them. I did try F# and it felt like a bastardized version of C# which I'm already not very fond of after working with it for three years.All of this is rather subjective but there seems to be a broad agreement when it comes to Haskell that it's very elegant and has a very steep learning curve.If you have a strong math/logic background and you're looking to enjoy the process of writing code rather then enjoying running the program then I think Haskell is for you.With that said I'm not sure if modelling physics is the best way to enjoy functional programming.,AxelLuktarGott,2025-12-30 16:35:00,1,learnprogramming,t3_1py4cgf,False,

When to Split into Modules*** **The Scroll Rule:** If you find yourself scrolling up and down constantly to find a function, split the file.* **Cognitive Load:** If a file handles Database logic *and* UI logic, split them. Keep files focused on one ""domain"" (e.g., [`database.py`](http://database.py), `api.py`).* **Reusability:** If you need a function in two different scripts, move it to a shared `utils` module.**3. Patterns to Learn Early*** **The Entry Guard:** Always wrap your execution logic. This prevents code from running if you import the file elsewhere. Pythonif \_\_name\_\_ == ""\_\_main\_\_"": main() * **Virtual Environments:** Never install libraries globally. Always use `venv` (or `poetry`/`uv`) for every project.* **Type Hinting:** Start using standard type hints (e.g., `def greet(name: str) -> str:`).

The reality is you meet bare minimum FDA standards for a safe product and go no further. The problem at the companies I worked for is that you were not selling to the end user.You are making money from insurance companies on things like disposable components that you change each treatment. A dialysis machine is expensive and the vast majority of people on dialysis are paying for it with insurance and not out of pocket. That means investing on making a really nice UX is not any priority.At the companies I worked at they don't make extra money investing a lot of time and effort on a well thought out UX, weather that is the UI or the physical device.

And the old idea that shitty companies won't make money and go out of business wasn't my experience. These companies have been around since the early 80's and making money hand over first.All of the devices were designed in a way to require constant payments from insurance companies through components that needed to be replaced periodically, if not after each treatment. Oh and who makes these components with custom connections that only fit our devices? Oh we do, so buy them from us!Yes after 20 years or something like that when the patent experiences it is a free for everybody to use, but at that point the company has already released other medical devices, with new patents, and different special connections.

nvnl04i,"This is going to be a copy paste of a reply that I gave to a similar question. It’s my honest experience. No at least where I am, it’s not just a small companies thing. Here it goes:I can offer my perspective as a junior. Got a job a year before graduation.TLDR: It’s still possible to make it, but you need a degree *with* internships. If you want to guarantee yourself a job, it’s going to be *hard* work, unless you’re a genius. I’m not a genius. Caveat that I’m Canadian, the market might be better or worse where you are.More details to give you an idea: I left my previous stem degree in 2022 when I realized that it wasn’t likely to yield a stable job. I started the CS degree in 2022. I’d programmed a bit before, always liked math and it seemed like a field with a bright future. I jumped in. Things turned sour for my cohort very quickly. By late 2022, many internships were rescinded, postings on universities’ coop programs dropped dramatically, the layoffs *started*. I was pretty dismayed by this to be honest, I’d left a degree that I loved in large part for improved job prospects and now there was a very real chance that it had been a poor decision. My family and I are really not rich (lower middle class at best) so I didn’t have much a choice, I wasn’t sure what else I could do either so I decided to work *hard*. I got perfect grades, I worked on eyebrow raising side projects, I TAed a math heavy class (thanks to my previous background in my other degree), I prepped for interviews. Got my first internship in my first year of the CS degree. Had to move to a different city temporarily for it. I didn’t quite like the particular field that it was in but it was really important for my CV, I finished it and got a good review. Didn’t want to stay in the city I moved to, so I decided to find another internship. Kept doing all of the above mentioned extracurriculars and still kept my grades very high. Meanwhile, things kept deteriorating for most of my cohort, the “best” students got internships, the majority did not. Keep in mind that I’m in coop so internships are *mandatory*.Prepped harder for interviews. Got a bigger company for the second one. If my first internship taught me anything it’s that if you want to be kept on after in this job market, you better be really good. I hit the ground running at this one, lost track of the hours I put into upskilling for it. I also took classes to not put off my graduation date. By the end of the 4 months, I was shipping year end deliverables. They were pretty happy and kept me on. Salary is about 80-90k TC. Quite good for a new grad in Canada. It’s been a huge relief and I’m immensely grateful for it.End all be all, success story in adverse job market conditions, but I want to be honest with you. I haven’t had a life for the past 2 and a half years or so. It’s literally all been school and working on side projects and interview prep and TAing. Now it’s working and still going to school. My relationship blew up and I haven’t been able to date because I just don’t have time, I don’t see my friends often. My own family that I live with doesn’t even talk to me often because I’m always in my room working one way or the other, they’re understanding and supportive though.I don’t want to complain at all because this is a thousand times preferable to being poor, but I want to highlight that this is what it takes to *guarantee* yourself a job now. You have to be the best of the best, whatever best means to the job market. Most of my cohort has not gotten internships and quite a few universities are working out deals with students: decreasing the number of internships, loosening the requirements of what classes to take when, actively involving themselves in our search.

As a separate point, I suggest that there's multiple ways to approach becoming more comfortable, less nervous\*, and cognitively smooth during interviews.

And then are you really sure you want to take those 13 years of experience and basically flush it down the toilet? Because that's effectively what you'd be doing at that point. Basically no going back to tech if you go that route.- In regards to starting a business, you really should think long and hard about some of the problems you've encountered at work in the past and see if there are missing tools that you could work on.

Or it could be low latency code. Anything that is not web based usually will be subject to a tighter ressources allocation and thus performance being more important. Think of something mass produced, throwing 50$ more for better ram because you produced shit code and the price of the product is around 50$... It's just not acceptable.A real life example:Sicentific computing is usually very computing heavy for things like simulations or lots of dimensional processing (think RGBs processing but on 280++ channels instead of just 3). These sometimes have tight performance requirements such as processing before another data package is generated. My job is essentially that. I take bleeding edge reasearch code in python made by physicist and optimize the shit out of it so it takes little to no time to process. Initially the processing time was 18h ++ per dataset and now it's down to sub 2h making it so that we process faster than we acquire. This means it's processed in real time and you can have the results immediately which is neat for aviation decision, threat detection and all stuff highly critical.Usually it will require you to work with people of other domain which is very fun I think. You become good at physics, geospatial and other math heavy domain which makes leetcode feels even more stupid (because the time/space complexity is not all you look for in performance computing and usually one of the easiest thing to optimize). Overall, it's a very rewarding field as you may be recruted for satellites, geospatial, lots of physics project that are bleeding edge, quantum computing, etc.",Aware-Individual-827,2025-12-26 10:23:02,11,cscareerquestions,t3_1pvwuzd,False,

nvwglc5,"\> being on mobile just seems like being a super small part of the projectI think there's something more to be said about this. It sounds to me like you are thinking in terms of android apps that are front-ends (effectively, websites). Thus, your logical conclusion is that to gain 'more depth' and employability, you should develop expertise in all parts of the application (i.e., backend).I want to challenge that point of view, and emphasize a few job-niches where smartphone apps really leverage the local computing power of a Snapdragon-level processor. In these cases, the app is not only a *part* of the project, it is *integral*. The android expertise you have is incredibly valuable for this use case.Take [ATAK-Civ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atakmap.app.civ) for example. It is a micro-ecosystem of apps and plugins that are used as tools for first-responding and security. Companies develop ATAK plugins using standard android tools, to do things like build software controllers for drones within ATAK, or stream health data from smartwatches of field operatives.Alternatively, Android (the operating system) is used by some companies for their own non-smartphone products. I recently interviewed with a company that builds treadmills. The treadmills use stock android for their OS and applications to serve standard functionality to their users and control hardware.These are small companies, sure. There are hurdles to finding these, especially since you're not in the US. You will have to do research to find such companies. And they may pay less than a large company like the one you're at, because the scale of the revenue they generate is going to be intrinsically smaller (the other side of that coin is that the revenue is shared with fewer individuals, so you may actually get paid pretty well anyway). But they are working on *cool shit,* and they want experts in the tools to help them do so.Source: I am one of those guys working on cool shit",eebis_deebis,2025-12-25 18:10:48,15,cscareerquestions,t3_1pvi2vo,False,

With my job and what worked for me was asking my team leader if there were any areas where he felt I was lacking or could improve. The company had fortnightly 1 on 1 with me and my team leader so I could have regular private conversations and ask about my performance. For “stepping up” for that getting ahead in your own time management is good, if I was running short on work and would have nothing to do soon, I would shoot an email to my team leader giving him an update on my progress, that I should be finished soon and ask if there’s anything specific that he wants me to work on next. Another good thing to do is shared knowledge. This isn’t something everyone can do in the first year. In my job we recently started trying out a new tool to help speed up debugging part of the software we use, because I had less work I had more time to allocate to learning the specifics and how to set up quickly and link it up. Because of this when senior team members had the time to sit down and go over it, I was able to “train” them on the new tool and pass on everything I learned to speed up their onboarding on the tool. Just because a team member is senior to you does not mean you can’t help them. Also they won’t know everything.

Working with video, in aerospace or on projects with embedded code are all pretty C++-heavy positions at the moment. If you're getting heavily into it, you should probably get comfortable setting up your CMake instrumentation and maybe experiment with test driven development if you have some free time. I'd never fully drunk the whole test driven development kool-aid to the point of ""write your first test before you write your first class"", but I was pretty close to that on my codegen project and it's a great way to get unstuck with your design and focus on the very next thing in front of you.

Someone else does that and the FE devs just implement the design given to them.Once you feel comfortable using whatever language and library you choose, the next steps are to at least have some basic level of understanding of containerization (docker and kubernetes), cloud engineering (AWS or Azure usually), and CI/CD pipelines (github actions). If you can build a full front-end app, containerize it with docker, and deploy the kubernetes pod to a azure/aws instance using github actions, you should be a really really strong candidate in your interviews.

It's typical that you would work at the level you're trying to move to for 6 months to a year before getting moved.
