If average transaction amounts suddenly double, that's a red flag even if the values are technically valid.* Monitor schema changes proactively. When a new status code appears or a column's type shifts, alert on it instead of silently dropping data.* Compare against historical baselines. A 15% change in distinct customer counts might be normal growth, or it might be double-counting. Context matters.The tricky part is reducing false positives—weekend vs weekday patterns, seasonality, etc. I've been using type-specific thresholds and adaptive baselines (moving averages for high-variance columns, prior period for seasonal ones).Schema and row counts are easy; catching that a source system changed from dollars to cents is harder.

There are some people (usually from a Java background and sometimes C++) that seem to think all production code must be OOP which it sounds like you have run into. This mindset leads to odd things in Python, like classes with only one method other than init (just write a function) and classes with only static methods (just put the functions in a module).Python often lets you write simple clean code by just putting functions in modules or passing them as arguments without classes. In a lot of DE code, functions are often only run once rather than many times across an application so there is less utility for OOP than there is in SWE.OOP is worth knowing of course. Some examples from the last week I've had is writing my own Operators and Hooks in Airflow which requires you to inherit from various base classes, another would be managing database connections. I have also written code using the connector design pattern to allow easy connections to many different cloud storages for a pipeline.Python is a very loosy goosey language in OOP terms so I'd stick to Python specific resources or you will get confused. I'd recommend ""Python 3 Object-Oriented Programming: Build robust and maintainable software with object-oriented design patterns in Python 3.8"" by Dusty Phillips.

Nothing frustrates me more than getting assigned an AI merge request, or to maintain a package originally written with AI. They tend to be 10x longer than human generated ones and a pain to verify, and the AI makes tons of mistakes. I'm almost at the point of outright rejecting them.I use AI in a limited capacity as a tool to make me faster.If there's a function I don't understand, AI is usually pretty good at explaining it faster than official docs, but have to be very careful with niche systems and their complex functionality. I've seen it outright fabricate what the behaviour is in a confident way.If there's a simple one of script, AI is usually fast to write it, such as ""Write a python script to download this bucket of files then parse the json of the files to extract this field and output it"" so I can find bad values that are breaking pipelines.It's great for the little things, and outright horrible for the bigger things, and anyone who thinks it can handle the bigger things is causing more problems than they are solving and actively degrading system reliability.

Not DQ, just an evolution of how you need to interpret the data. E.g. Maybe the developers of the source application are now ""overloading"" the orders table, using it intentionally to store some entity that isn't strictly an order, but has very similar columns - except there's no such thing as a user for this new concept. There's probably a type_id or similar in this case, that has a new value distinguishing this novel use case from the old use case. All this is just one example explanation, of many; the wider point is, there could be a good reason why the userid column is null. Rather than going to the data owner trying to raise it as an assumed problem, you might get a quicker answer if you assume the best and just ask ""can someone tell me what it means when there's a null userid?"".

When new data arrives, compare against this metadata to determine what's actually new vs. what you can skip.\*\*On the Part\_Number optionality:\*\*Since Parts are optional and variable per AP, I'd process at the AP level and handle Parts within that processing step rather than trying to partition by them.\*\*Alternative approach:\*\*What if you partition by ingestion batch (timestamp when client sends data) rather than by the hierarchical data structure? Each batch could contain multiple EQPs/APs, but you'd process the whole batch as one unit. Downstream, you'd have the full data hierarchy in your warehouse with proper keys for querying.\*\*Question for you:\*\*What drives the need to reprocess individual APs?

nq55q2b,"42 years of experience here. Lost my job due to an automobile accident where I broke my hip bone, my trochanter and my right femur bone. I was in the hospital for 2 weeks and then it took me 6 months to learn to walk again. When I reported back to my job when the surgeon ended my FMLA and I could prove I could descend down 2 flights of stairs in less than a minute, my office was on the 3rd floor of a 5 story building. I had to prove that in case of a fire in the building and couldn't rely on anyone to help me down the stairs. But as I made it back to work after 6 months, my termination papers were waiting for me as they had already replaced me. I say that to say that every in person interview I have ever been to in the last 41 years, I was always offered the job. I've been been to 4 in person interviews this year and none of them have contacted me after I left the building. But all 4 interviews have gone the exact same way that your interview has gone. When I sat down with other employees for a technical review, all 4 interviews with them would ask odd ball questions that had nothing to do with programming. Most of the people I had interviewed with I saw a sheet where they had to google for these odd ball questions. I'm also a back end developer and one question I was asked is how would I use a Friend Class in C#. Now Friend classes are mostly used by testers, not developers. I've never ever used a Friend class in production. But the guy asking the questions wanted an answer, I made up some answer of how I would track down a bug that was happening in a Entity Framework class and returning invalid data. I said I would use the a Friend class to inject various variables into the Framework class to possibly see where the problem is coming from. Now it would really be a lame company to work for if they were using Friend classes in production, and I would bet that they were not. But the guy interviewing me said ""Well, that isn't what we would do."" The interview then ended. The manager would return to the conference room and I would be walked out the building. More than likely it was just a gotcha question to say that we interviewed US citizens and none of them were qualified for the position so we need to apply for more H1B visa holders, or something similar.

nq2lvlt,"It's normal.There is a tremendous difference between what you can/will learn in school (which isn't much), what you'll use on the job/in projects, and what is sought after/asked in interviews. It is not even close to being the same.Treat it as a learning experience and understand that preparing for technical interviews is very very different. Remember that interviews are intentionally designed to expose what you *don't* now. Good interviewers rarely focus on what you *do* know. Interviewing is a skill and you should definitely focus on it if those skills are weak.I would actually argue that with these concepts.. the theoretical foundations have to be there, yes, but how it's applied in real world scenarios is far more important. The edge cases, the pragmatic approaches.. the theory only goes so far. And the only thing that matters here is experience. You won't really understand hashing until you've screwed it up. You only really understand securing an API until there you cause an unauthed API incident, etc. Having text book theory about all of these with no real world use is actually worse. Best to be honest and say, ""I don't understand the inner workings entirely, but this is how I have used it, and this is what I learned, found interesting, found tricky..""The other thing you nailed, was your understanding about your communication style. You need to develop clear, concise, confident, vocabulary about these concepts, it has to be second nature.Of course, any seasoned dev can google/stackoverflow/llm the answers and patch something together in a real job context. But can they think and speak on the spot and come up with a clear approach to a complex problem? Interviewers look for ""architectural sense"". Are they just slapping ideas together, or can they actually build and piece together a system, that works? Can they document and write a spec, without help?Your ability to communicate ideas, problems, solutions, and tradeoffs, as a dev is more important than your ability to code. Maybe not at first when you're getting started, but certainly in mid career, and late career, it's everything.There are plenty of resources and courses online to learn about just about everything. It needs to become an obsession on your part, to consume as much knowledge as you can AND then apply it in personal projects, over and over again, from scratch, from frameworks, from everything, until the skills are cemented. It's brutally tough, I get it. There's so much to learn and specialize into.But in this job market and hiring climate, only the obsessed, people who truly love this stuff, will make it.

Algorithms, data structures, how hardware and compilers actually work. You don’t need all of it to get started, but the more serious the system gets, the more that knowledge saves you from building something fragile.For job prospects: most junior roles care way more about whether you can solve problems and ship small things.

One activity of that work is programming (writing the actual code that accomplishes the task), but there is a lot more involved such as understanding requirements, and design. It turns out that if we just start coding from our heads we inevitably run into problems so there are strategies and best practices that aim to reduce the likelihood of things going badly.Regarding job prospects software developers often have degrees in either discipline and in many ways they end up overlapping so it doesn't matter too much which one you pick, what matters is that you put in a lot of effort to actually become good at your job.",willbdb425,2025-11-20 11:56:16,1,learnprogramming,t3_1p20nzl,False,

Sure, it's not an SQL course but a database design course - but these features are capabilities of databases nowadays that can be used.- you seem to do this implementation agnostic, but some stuff here is highly database dependent. Postgres does not have a tinyint type, text data behaves very differently on MySQL vs Postgres.

I focus heavily on entities, relationships, cardinalities, constraints, and conceptual/logic design. Because of that, relational algebra, window functions, etc aren't core to the curriculum for this class.* I also intentionally keep the SQL examples **implementation-agnostic**. If all you want to learn is vendor differences, you need to look elsewhere.* For the data types videos, the goal is to give beginners enough intuition to make reasonable design decisions, not to provide an exhaustive catalog of every nuance across engines.* As for NULL semantics, that topic *is* included, but it shows up later because students need some conceptual grounding first. By the time they get there, they’re ready for a deeper discussion of null traps.* As for ""A table is used to represent a single entity"", it helps beginners learn in the 1st lesson. Nuances like junction tables are inappropriate in the 1st lesson, and are covered as the course progresses.These choices are mainly for pacing and approachability, especially for students encountering databases for the first time.

It will essentially go through line by line, and then look for similarities to the library. I can only think of how to apply it to essays and papers, but it could be:1. Step 1: Start with similar words. The checker will take the piece you're working on, and compare similar words to others. If the piece you're working on reveals a high number of shared words, then it gets ""flagged"" for further examination. 2. Step 2: Take the piece you're comparing, and the other pieces of work that share some close similarities, and then reveal similar phrases/sentences. If the similar phrases ended up being long enough (multiple words/sentences), then the likelihood that it was plagiarized increases. (ie: a phrase ""too bad"" isn't going to flag it, but if someone quotes a full abstract from a scientific paper then it flags it as copied).3. Step 3: determine a way to program it to detect plagiarism vs referencing/quoting other works. You'd have to look up formatting options (like the usage of quotation marks, and other steps required to reference other notations). 4.

nqs1wea,"One issue with just using edit distance is that if you have a huge database of files/texts to compare against, computing the edit distance of an input file against all possible matches is computationally very expensive.To speed this kind of thing up, you generally want to use some kind of index to compute *approximately* similar matches quickly. And then if you want, you can compute the exact edit distance for just those matches, to narrow down the results.One basic strategy is to look at [n-grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) (consecutive sequences of either words or characters, for some reasonable value of n). In practice, when two documents have a small edit distance, they typically also have a large number of n-grams in common. The fraction of n-grams in common between two sets is called the [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index), and it's a pretty good measure of similarity, even though it ignores the ordering of chunks that are bigger than an n-gram.Computing Jaccard similarity for all pairs of documents is also expensive, but there's a trick to speed it up called [min-hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash). If you hash all the n-grams in a document, and then throw out all except the smallest k, then *on average* the similarity of the subsets will be the same as the similarity of the original documents (with more random variation as k gets smaller). So you can adjust k to trade off speed against accuracy.Fun trivia: this technique was invented almost 30 years ago for AltaVista, which was one of the earliest and most popular web search engines until Google came along and ate its lunch.",teraflop,2025-11-25 22:02:08,2,learnprogramming,t1_nqqheq1,False,

I know most of the terms used, I have done the relevant math manually and programmed it before. Everything fits into the models I have built in my brain neatly.

Everytime I read an unfamiliar word, I had to go back, and refresh my memory of that specific thing. ""How does XYZ relate to ABC again?"". The more unfamiliar words, concepts and language features you have to keep in your head, the harder it will always be for you to read documentation, or to plan and write complex code. There are basically two ways to learn this stuff: Theoretical and Practical. Theoretical covers stuff like lectures, and classes, but also online courses, reading a book or a tutorial. This can help you gain information a lot faster, since it is (hopefully) well structured and presented in a proper way to learn. Practical is things like coding, but also exercises you would do for class or for a course (or in a book). This will solidify the knowledge you gained from the theoretical part. It also forms shortcuts in your brain. After you have build the third backed with APIs, you will instantly know what to do when you start your fourth. You will have a folder structure figured out, some patterns you want to use, and how to name the endpoints.

One of the greatest difficulties at being good at writing software is being able to find good documentation. Without good documentation, it is extremely difficult to write good code.Despite what many may think, one of the best things Microsoft did in their early days was to provide exceptionally good documentation. Their MSDN documentation was distributed in CD-ROM format, and it provided gigabyte levels of very accurate technical information. It was called the MSDN Library.Microsoft would pay their technical writers' large amounts of money to produce highly accurate technical documentation.Those roles are now gone, as technical documentation now comes down to reading the source code or battling through autogenerated documentation.But the lack of high-quality documentation is missed, at least by me.",ScholarNo5983,2025-11-21 14:33:23,1,learnprogramming,t3_1p2yq3a,False,

npp1x74,"The value of taking notes isn't the note itself, it's having written it in the first place. You are exercising your mind by writing it.In the industry, documentation is scarce. The point of you writing your documentation is to get you to think about what you're doing in your homework. You're practicing structured thinking and discipline. It's helping you more than you realize.The only reason I write documentation is when I'm publishing an API. Clients rely on accurate documentation when consuming 3rd party code. The documentation is either correct - or it's COMPLETELY DEAD. If your documentation betrays the client, they'll never trust the documentation or the product ever again. You wouldn't, if it were you.Beyond that, there are design documents that describe system architecture at a high level. This is for internal consumption for my colleagues. I don't rely on my own documentation.The last layer of documentation is the source code itself. The program documents itself. Abstraction hides complexity and tells us WHAT - this is the most important; an `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`. The implementation tells us HOW - and we really don't care. `std::for_each` could be in terms of `for`, `while`, or `goto`, I don't give a fucking shit. Comments in the code tell us WHY, and provides context.Outside of your class requirements, you never write documentation that tells us what the code tells us. If I see: template std::span::iterator median(std::span);I don't need to be told the `median` function computes a median. I need to be told the parameters are a sorted range and the return value is within the range, because I can't express that in code. I need to know the rounding function used, as it's consequential. I don't care how the median is computed, otherwise.There are a TON of bad comments, and they should tickle your intuition that something ain't right. The problem with comments that tell me what the code tells me is who is the authority? The code or the comment? This matters when the code and the comment don't agree - which they usually don't. A comment might be a heading, telling us where we are and what the next segment does. We call those ""functions"". Break your code up. Let the compiler elide the calls and composite the function for you. It's a sign your functions are too big.Another way comments and documentation warn you of bad code is that the whole thing is bad. Getters and setters - ""Gets the thing"", and ""Sets the thing"". Bad sign. Getters and setters are not OOP, if you're busy learning that, they're an anti-pattern. It's a sign of boilerplate - which there should be none. It's redundant. You have a misunderstanding of applied software engineering, and this code can't be justified when there are equal or superior solutions.Use bad documentation as a test for code quality. It takes time and practice, and a development of a deep understanding of idioms, paradigms, patterns, and our craft.

nqb8wp6,"You haven't said anything about what sort of languages or frameworks you are already working in. There are many (many, many) ways to accomplish this, so it's hard to give a good recommendation without it.I will recommend Python for the programming language, Flask for the web framework, and Waitress for the server. Python is about the simplest language to learn, Flask provides tools for building a web service in Python, and Waitress acts as a go-between to accept browser requests, turn them into calls to your program, and send the results back again. I would also recommend Flask-RESTful (I would structure the form submission as a REST API call). All of these have very good documentation.Note that as a security measure Waitress only responds to the 127.0.0.1 interface (your local-machine loopback) and cannot bind to ports under 1024, so you would usually bind to port 8000 or 8080. For local testing or demonstration this is quite sufficient; if you want to serve pages to other machines, you would usually install nginx as a reverse proxy.Your laptop very likely already has Python installed, but it is a good idea to make sure it is up to date. If you open a command-line window and run ""python -V"" it should respond with something like ""Python 3.12.3"". The current stable version is 3.14.0, and that is the one you should be running unless there is some specific reason you can't. (On Windows! On Mac or Linux, don't go monkeying with the system-provided version.)It is recommended to start by setting up a virtual environment, to prevent something you're adding from interfering with things you've already installed. You can do this by running ""python -m venv my_app"" followed by ""my_app\Scripts\activate"". You can now install the modules by running ""pip install Flask flask-restful waitress"" and start work.Check the Flask getting-started docs; it will walk you through writing a minimal web app. Use templates; you can probably drop most of your existing html code into template files and use it from there with minimal modification and without cluttering up your code. Check the Waitress docs; they will show you how to call your app and get it running. Try to keep everything as simple as possible until you get a minimal version up and running; you can always gild it later.Good luck! :four_leaf_clover:",Veterinarian_Scared,2025-11-23 05:10:26,1,learnprogramming,t3_1p46r8t,False,
nqcxls4,"For what you are asking to do, there isn't much special about a server.Your laptop is a PC and is perfectly capable of being both the server and the client for what you are proposing.There are lots of things you can do to make it more ubiquitous- for example if you could get a static IP allocated and have it added to a DNS, you could look it up from any computer using the network name (e.g. https://www.myserver.com/).But if you can't do that (the more likely scenario) you can just look up its dynamically allocated IP address and use that instead (e.g. https://1.2.3.4/ or whatever address you are assigned in place of 1.2.3.4).More importantly if you want people to access your server running on your laptop from another computer you will almost certainly need to open the port that the server is listening on.For example, let's say you setup a ""web site"" using apache tomcat on your laptop. Apache tomcat, by default listens on port 8080 (for unencrypted traffic and 8443 for https if memory serves). So, if you opened up your browser and entered http://localhost:8080/mystery, then assuming your web app is called ""mystery"" you should see the index.html (or index.jsp) of your site.Now if you determine that your IP is 1.2.3.4 (it won't be, but let's assume it is) you could go to another PC and enter http://1.2.3.4:8080/mystery then you will likely get a ""host refused connection"" error. This is because the firewall on your laptop isn't allowing anything from the outside to get through - unless you set up the firewall to allow external traffic using port 8080 (or 8443 if you want https) to get through...Note, if you do open any ports, only open the one or two that you allow and when you are done close them. In fact I would open them when I needed them to be open and close them once I've done the demo from the other computer.There are plenty of other potential things you may need to take into account. For example, it will be much easier if both computers are in the same ""subnet"". If you don't know what that means, then just connect to the same wifi AP and hope that the configurations are such that they connect to the same subnet (e.g. try not to use a professors laptop and your student laptop - this is unlikely to be an issue as it is unlikely that there will be such configuration issues, but you never know for sure unless you try it and know what to look for when it doesn't work on some computers ).",gm310509,2025-11-23 14:08:18,1,learnprogramming,t3_1p46r8t,False,

nqdddf7,"Like any other programming problem: start by clearly saying *what* you're trying to do, then break that down into smaller subproblems or steps until it's approachable.It sounds like you want to identify *all* of the possible poker hands. Start with just one type of hand, e.g. a flush.What's the definition of a flush? It's a hand where all the cards are the same suit.One possible way of doing it is to say: ""a hand is a flush if: it's all hearts, OR all clubs, OR all diamonds, OR all spades"". And then write code to check each of those four conditions. This approach will work but it's a bit tedious.If you think about it for a second, then it should be obvious that ""a hand where all cards are the same suit"" is equivalent to ""a hand where all cards have the same suit as the first card."" So you don't need to write four separate checks for the four possible suits.And so on. You can repeat this kind of analysis for each type of hand. For some of the hand types, you will need to examine multiple possibilities, e.g. for two pair, you'll need to check the different possible cards that might make up a pair. For a straight, you'll need to check whether there's a straight with aces low (5-4-3-2-A) or aces high (A-K-Q-J-10).There are many possible ways to implement this. If you're a beginner, I would suggest that you first focus on getting something that works *correctly*, even if it's ugly or verbose, and then look for ways to simplify and optimize it.

nqdha6e,"That's a fun exercise. I haven't seen your code, but my immediate thought was how do you compare the cards? Their suits and values? So, how I would've done that is this - I'd create a Card class, so i don't have to store suit and value as a raw dictionary, instead i can assign those to a card's attributes through constructor, e.g.```card1 = Card(:red_heart:, ""Q"")card2 = Card(:red_heart:, ""7"")card3 = Card(:club_suit:, ""J"")```Also, I'd override comparison dunder methods in Card class, so that i can compare two cards like this:```def __eq__(self, other): if self.suit != other.suit: print(""Can't compare cards with different suits"") else: return self.value == other.value```And ""less than"" dunder method, so i can tell if the card has higher or lower value:```def __lt__(self, other): if self.suit != other.suit: print(""Can't compare cards with different suits"") else: return self.value < other.value```I would also wright a method to compare suits, so i can understand how cards relate to each other.And also, think about how you, as a human, identify that you have a flush, for example? You will take a look at you two cards, check their suits, ignoring their value, then you'll take a look at the table to compare those card's suits to the ones that you have on hand, and IF total amount of cards with the same suit is 5 - you have a flush!

When you write a program, there are typically a lot of libraries with commonplace code you're using (iostream in C++ for example). If like, 4/5 programs on your computer are using iostream, it kinda makes no sense for each program to store it individually, right? That wastes a ton of space. The solution is dynamic library files (these are "".so"", or "".dll"" files). A dynamically linked program will be compiled in such a way that when it needs access to a library, it will access the compiled library code at run-time from the library file instead of having it baked into the executable. Of course, you could just bake the library code into the executable as well. That's static linking, and it's common when you're writing a program for a system with limited space. It also means your entire program is all in one piece.As for dynamic/static typing, that's talking about the data being read. All data has ""types"". Data can be an integer, an unsigned integer, a character, a boolean value, a floating point number, a double floating point number, etc. and all of those are stored & interpreted differently by the computer - as far as it's concerned, everything's just 1s and 0s.

nqeetna,"To add a little more detail, linking relates to calling methods. It’s something you barely think about while coding. You just call one, but how does that actually work? Code is also stored in memory at runtime and instructions have memory addresses (line number offsets from the start of the executable file). To call a method, you create a new stack frame for it on top of the stack, set a return pointer to hold the line you are currently on, then jump to the first line of the function you called. At the end of the function, you set a return variable in the caller’s stack frame and jump back using the return pointer. So, how do you know where to jump? If it’s a method in the same assembly, that’s easy. If it’s in another assembly, you have to determine the jump address. That’s linking. Assemblies have a table of jump addresses at their start so it’s possible to read and set these addresses. Static linkers set this at compile time and if the actual assembly used differs at runtime, interesting things can happen. Dynamic linkers use a runtime to load assemblies and will resolve these jump addresses at that point. Note that virtual methods that support polymorphism have an expanded table of jump addresses by concrete type since they can overload methods. The runtime selects the jump address based on the actual type at runtime. See v-tables for more information.Typing. All memory storage ultimately has a type. It has to since types are literally encoded differently and processed by different cpu components. You can choose to set that type yourself at compile time (statically) or let the runtime take its best guess (dynamic). The later is rarely necessary with objects in languages that support ad-hoc tuples (like js grab bag objects). With primitives or collections of primitives, it’s not a good practice. With types, you want strongly typed code that lets the compiler do as much validation for you as possible.

nq8rkx8,"at a high level, there are 2 types of embedded systems. I used to work on large unmanned systems, and we used stuff like PC104 computers with serial ports. The line of code you reference in your question would be an invocation of a library function, and that library function would talk to a driver, and that driver would send voltages out the USB port that produce the required signals to tell a motor to run or an actuator to move or the like, or it might read a camera video stream or a lidar or gps output. This is not much different from coding up a laptop or something, these computers had a full operating system and mouse/keyboard/monitor support for diagnostic efforts and so on. Its 'barely' embedded, in the big picture of that world, but we made many a 'robot' (mostly, unmanned aircraft and later, watercraft) with those tools. The other level is where you do more of that hands on, sometimes actually wiring devices together yourself and sending voltages to them with some agreed upon way, often directly setting an address to a value using a C or assembly like language. I did a lot less of that, as it is slower to produce the product and a lot more weeds to get into for each individual component. For example we had one 'smart' actuator that ran code, but you had to wire it up a certain way to accept a program and then wire it up a different way to run the program installed on it automatically when it got powered on. There was extensive documentation for making that work. I would start with a simulation. keep the stuff that would be hardware isolated so you can replace it, and build a sim where you drive your robot around and have it do the things you want it to do all in just pure desktop code. Then if you want to build it, you can pick out the hardware and change out the isolated code to interface with the motors and sensors and all. We had full simulation for all our vehicles, crude but it got the job done, to test our control systems and such safely in a virtual world.

For example, you could have a users table: create table users ( -- in SQLite this would be: id integer primary key autoincrement, id integer primary key generated always as identity, name text not null, favorite_color text );And then a `posts` table: create table posts ( -- these have their own ID! id integer primary key generated always as identity, -- then we link them to a user user_id integer not null references users(id), title text not null, body text not null );That way, the database engine will check that the user you're trying to reference when you insert new posts actually exists.

This allows you to add automatic checks on tables, which adds security as you can't accidentally forget to add a user\_id checks.

The app-level concept of a user is separate from that, and rarely if ever is it combined. Managing database-level users for all your app-level users is a nightmare -- not to mention possible additional problems:- Having to also make extra policies for all your admin and DB maintenance users so they can do moderation or even just basic database migrations.- Having to reconnect to the database for every request, which may overwhelm it (max_connections is 100 or less by default on postgres).- Or making each request wait as you manually `set session authorization` to impersonate each user as their requests come in -- whereas if you only have a single user (your app itself) there's less to manage about the lifetime of each connection in relation to each request.Overall, it's not a common or a recommended solution.

npzis9p,I agree it would be inconvenient to create individual database users for each user. Linking just to the postgresql documentation is a bit misleading from me in this case.The pattern is to create a single authenticated role and pass the userId in a transaction scoped variable which postgres then uses in the WITH CHECK and USING clauses. This allows using a single connection.This is for example how supabase implements their RLS on their postgres databases. [https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security)PostgREST also has something similar with shared roles [https://docs.postgrest.org/en/v12/explanations/db\_authz.html#web-users-sharing-role](https://docs.postgrest.org/en/v12/explanations/db_authz.html#web-users-sharing-role),Independent-Fig6042,2025-11-21 07:32:55,1,learnprogramming,t1_npvcpn3,False,

When there is time pressure and the main goal is not to learn, it is to get the project done, then I magically start to prioritize things properly.I have side projects with no time pressure, usually they get nowhere, but I do not expect them to.If I am working by myself for myself, I have to create time pressure and reinforce it all the time, or else I get into study loops or refactoring loops or planning loops.My suggestion to you is to not direct your learning toward interviews, at least not as the main focus. Interviews are abstractions, they are meant to assess knowledge, but they are very flawed.If you focus on knowledge that helps you build actual software projects, that is useful, and nothing in the world can ever make that not useful.If you optimize for interviews and the interview landscape changes, then you have wasted your time.",azzalan,2025-11-22 14:59:48,2,learnprogramming,t3_1p3uqke,False,

nq939gd,"Fellow beginner here.To contain **rabbit holes**:Go a step beyond the abstraction, or what you actually need to know for what you're working on, then write down what you want to look at later (because you'll naturally have more questions) and continue with what you were initially doing.Keep most of your time focused on what you actually need to know, then when you're bored later, go through questions you were curious about earlier. Set a timer for that period of time, like 30min. When it stops, you stop. Add to that initial list of things you planned to research later.You won't memorize everything (and don't need to), and often times simply going through the main material, only learning enough to continue on with said material, will help you build a foundation to reinforce the rabbit holes you'd be digging through later. If you start with the rabbit hole first, then you may wind up with collapsed tunnels as you have nothing to tether that knowledge to. That'll result in digging those same tunnels later, wasting your time.Do just enough to build a basic mental model of the theory and your material. Only focus deeper when you need to.**If you need a different perspective:**Beginners in art require a lot of quantity to produce quality, and as they get more reps, the more quality becomes important. Starting with only one painting that they focus all their quality on often stunts their progress compared to those who've done a healthy mix of both. You're focusing way too much on quality. Lean more towards quantity for now.Programming is solving problems by building solutions, like a trade. You need to build a lot of projects to get better at programming so you have something to tether theory to. Learn what you need to build those projects and occasionally a step beyond, and that experience will reinforce the times you dig deeper.You *can* focus a lot on theory to make *learning how to build projects* a smoother process, but theory isn't the thing that makes you a programmer. Just like how knowing the properties of a hammer, how to make sandpaper, and different types of trees doesn't make a carpenter learn how to build a house, memorizing every definition, theory, syntax, etc, isn't going to be the thing that makes you learn how to build a program.You actually only need very basic theory to start building programs, just like a carpenter can start building incredible things with a hammer, nails, wood, and a saw. Keep to your priorities, as you'll likely be hired as a programmer, not a computer scientist. With that said, **chase the fun**.I actually enjoy digging into things and learning theory/CS concepts, so I like to mainly do that with little bits of project-building sprinkled in. That's severely limiting the speed of my growth as a programmer, but it's what keeps me interested in programming in the first place.

Once that foundation stops feeling heavy, start recreating small tools you already understand: a calculator, a todo list, a simple CLI game, anything where the logic is familiar. That’s where your brain starts connecting the dots between “writing code” and “building something.”LeetCode and the competitive stuff makes more sense *after* you’ve built a handful of small projects and can reason through the steps of a problem without panicking.

It is not for everyone and you’ll encounter a lot of detractors both inside and outside of healthcare. My advice is to discover it all for yourself if you have any interest.Also my tech skills have come in handy. Informatics is a field that seems to have a lot of happy people in it. I’ve been offered paid research opportunities already and I’ve helped worked through IT issues on the floor.You can earn your CNA (certified nursing assistant) in a month for like $2K max which involves working for nurses doing a lot of dirty work, but I got a job directly after which pays me to go to school. I’m also earning other certs and building clinical skills. There’s even CNAs who work remotely. The healthcare system will break your heart as well as warm your heart because it’s the intersection of the best and worst of humanity. There are people who put an insane amount of effort in to help people. There are folks who sit on their ass. MBAs are a problem in that field too.Even with the OBBBA it seems like hospitals still need folks (granted I’m in a major US city) and every nurse I’ve spoken to has said “you’ll never want for a job.” I don’t think I’ll get near my old salary by any means, but I feel it’s more consistent.

Learning a little bit of cloud and DevOps wouldn’t hurt either, it’s pretty expected these days. So learn the basis of Azure, AWS, or GCP to the standard that a dev is expected to. You don’t need to go super into the weeds, but get an understanding of CICD Pipelines, Kubernetes, Docker, etc.This is pretty much the bare minimum knowledge for devs with a few years experience nowadays at least for web devs.Do that then study some system design methods (neetcode has videos for it as well as leetcode) and a few DSA questions. Don’t go too overboard on it though like many here will, if you aren’t trying to crack Big Tech, a good chunk of companies don’t even ask leetcode.From there just apply and hope for the best, the market is as good as it was 3-4 years ago.Edit:Biggest thing is probably to not ask this sub for advice, it’s full of unemployed people, students, and sky is falling doomers that can’t see what their weaknesses are",kingofthesqueal,2025-11-23 17:04:30,12,cscareerquestions,t3_1p448bb,False,

As far as I can tell, the improvements in LLMs have really started to slow down, and I see no reason why they shouldn't continue slowing down even more given that:* There are limits to how much energy can be allocated to LLMs; this ultimately puts a limit on how much training can be done.* We are running out of additional data to train LLMs on; this is another thing which puts a limit on how much training can be done.* Low-hanging fruit of algorithmic/architectural improvements have largely been solved (from models like DeepSeek) so there are now fewer and fewer stones to turn in this regard.* Moore's Law is dying and the low-hanging fruit of hardware architecture improvements seem to be picked by and large, meaning that hardware efficiency improvements will likely plateau. (see [https://epoch.ai/blog/predicting-gpu-performance](https://epoch.ai/blog/predicting-gpu-performance) for what I'm talking about)* Neural scaling laws which model performance are inherently increasing BUT concave down when more parameters/data are added, meaning that improvements should continue to get smaller over time; and this is not just the case for LLMs, but for any AI that could exist.On top of that, there's reason to believe that the models may get worse. Much of the data now on the internet is AI-generated and it is inevitable that a great deal of it will be used to train new LLM models, thereby causing them to overfit and degrade somewhat. Let's also not forget that the CEOs and researchers have a lot to gain by hyping up AI, so if that is what is causing to feel concerned, try to not to let it get to you; there's a long history of this kind of stuff happening when relatively new technologies emerge, but the end result has always been exaggerations.",EntranceOrganic564,2025-11-24 17:15:16,13,cscareerquestions,t3_1p5lq1p,False,

I do have some listed on my linkedin/github profile page but these are the ones from when I was applying for my first role and for my resume I removed all but the one that was most fleshed out.> What should a senior dev actually focus on when entering the market for the first time?This might depend on your specialization/target role. For a senior level role, I would expect a lot of interviews to focus on strong system design (differs a bit between backend and frontend though). If you're targeting big tech, you're likely going to encounter some form of algorithm interview rounds. And of course, prepare for your standard behavioral questions as needed. A lot of times, these boil down how you resolve inter-personal issues of deadlines, disagreements, prioritization, etc.Outside of technical skills though, linkedin premium is probably a good place to start, though you might want to only use it for 2-3 months and decide from there if you still need it. I also think the primary thing to focus on is applying to listings early. Another side note for linkedin is to reply to recruiters if they do reach out, even if you are declining them. I believe doing so increases your profile's score/visibility to recruiters as someone that replies so you'll likely receive more recruiter outreach in the future.

I'm sure that if I got that promotion next year or the year after I'm still going to feel less capable than the 20 year guy. I'm going to meet the minimum and strive to be like the 20 year guy.

nq02iiz,"You've got a decent base for the resume (the AI transcription tool and the compiler project are solid), but they're getting buried under resume padding that actually makes you look less experienced/skilled rather than more.When you list basic CS fundamentals alongside advanced engineering work and harder courses, recruiters assume you're conflating simple homework with real projects. They can't tell what's impressive and what isn't, so they default to assuming it's all entry-level. Mention the most advanced courses, but cut things like ""Computer Science I/II"". A short list of courses that sound more impressive is better.The skills section needs serious trimming. That LeetCode level notation doesn't mean anything to most hiring managers. It's not an industry standard, and honestly it reads like you're trying too hard to quantify something that your GitHub and projects should already demonstrate. Same with the soft skills list. Saying you have ""time management"" is meaningless when you could just show it by describing how you delivered a complex medical AI tool with proper NLP pipelines and error detection.Your language list is creating a credibility problem. Eleven languages including VB and Prolog makes it look like you've dabbled in everything but mastered nothing. Recruiters know that's not realistic for someone graduating in 2026.

Don't bother listing languages where you're only familar that are unlikely to be relevant for the types of jobs you're pursuing to keep the length reasonable. That honesty will make you look more competent.The Task Scheduler project is actively hurting you.

You did a great job explaining the design patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer, Strategy), which shows architectural thinking, but you completely forgot to mention what you built it in. Unity with C#? Unreal with C++? Custom engine? The tech stack matters way more to a hiring manager than knowing it was inspired by backrooms-style horror games.More generally, every bullet point should pass this test: would a junior developer find this impressive, or would they think ""yeah, that's just normal programming""? If it's the latter, cut it. Your resume should show the ceiling of what you can do, not document every step of your learning process.

Determining the numerical sensitivity of an algorithm or function to small floating point perturbations. This would include, notably, numerical linear algebra, which underpins all statistical and machine-learning oriented algorithms.2. Optimization algorithms, in which you study how to find the minimum solution to some equation and/or constraints by using calculus. Would be useful in any industrial engineering-type software.3. Classical Big-O notation, which describes growth rates as a function of input size. Useful for understanding whether your algorithms are prohibitively expensive when scaled up.4. Simulation of physical motion or physical behaviors, as used in computer graphics and visualization, scientific computing, signal processing and other similar physics-oriented domains.In summary, I would say that calculus does indeed play a foundational role in the study of many core CS algorithmic domains. Note that these algorithmic domains don't necessarily have a lot of overlap with the kind of work you might do in industry, unless you're working on cutting edge stuff.

nqdekb4,"TLDR: Don’t move for less than 300-400k, Consider moving within Canada first. Canadian SWE (6 yoe) current living and working in NYC. From my opinion, it’s only really worth it if you can make significantly high salary, such that you can buy your way out of American problems. This is significantly harder for someone with a family, as your expenses will be higher and you will be impacted by more specific issues than someone who is single (Schools, Health care costs, etc). Even in a lower cost region like Baltimore, I wouldn’t move for anything less than 100-300% salary increase over your Canadian salary. If you’re really committed to this - Don’t focus on the L1-B visa, Consider TN. Apply externally to jobs in cities with tech hubs (SF, NYC, Seattle). With your YOE you should be able to get some decent high paying jobs (200k-400k). These should pay enough for you to support your family with 1 income; so even if your spouse can’t secure a visa, it’s still manageable. - Plan for potential private school expenses. Public education varies based on where you live, so either plan on paying more rent in a high income area or paying for private. - Plan for a short stay. Both L1B and TN are employer tied. So you WILL (not maybe) eventually find yourself having to come back to canada quickly if your employment ends. - The tech market is tough right now, but from what I’ve seen it’s still pretty competitive for senior level roles. Tbh, Consider moving within Canada. There are definitely senior level jobs in Canada that pay way more than 100k, you may just have to move to Toronto or Vancouver.

You know beforehand and you call them out when you see them coming. Giving stakeholders a heads up is good. No heads up when people are counting on you is really bad.In general though it sounds like you just need to spend some time so be sure to get AI to summarize docs for you and help you with coding as well. This will limit the number of surprises but surprises always happen. If you never hit surprises then the scope of your work isn’t big enough for you and you’re ready for more challenging work.

Yeah no one really can unless they’re super familiar with the subject matter. When your work becomes more ambiguous as your level goes up these can be more difficult.

I've found that [test driven development](https://wiki.c2.com/?TestDrivenDevelopment) or at the very least development where you write a method or two in your classes (assuming you're an OO shop) and then write some tests to test them will highlight deficiencies in your design without you designing a bunch of extra stuff you're never going to need. If you find yourself with some down time, you can also go back and write tests for older code if it's possible to do so. A lot of the time older code is heavily coupled and can't really be used outside its existing context, so it can be difficult to do that.Identifying pain points to fix when you have some refactoring time can also be helpful. You can often clean up a bit around code you're working on without it taking too much more time and without impacting a huge amount of the code base.
