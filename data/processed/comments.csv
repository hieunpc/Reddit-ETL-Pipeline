Even when modeling could be part of the design, timelines usually cut it first.* Storing source data indefinitely is becoming common, which makes replaying historical transformations feel like an acceptable substitute for managing change semantics.* Data teams are increasingly embedded in business units. Without a central steward, consistency across domains erodes even when the same underlying data is reused.* AI increases speed and lowers the cost of repetitive work, which further shifts effort toward shipping and iteration rather than integration rigor.* The idea of a single source of truth still matters philosophically, but if leadership doesn’t care when numbers don’t line up exactly, it’s hard to justify enforcing it.The common thread is that modern data systems are optimized for reversibility rather than correctness. Cheap compute, infinite retention, replayability, and AI assisted iteration all increase tolerance for semantic drift. Dimensional modeling still addresses that problem, but its value only materializes when the organization is forced to care about consistency over time.

o3zggge,"My POV is someone who is closely following the work happening in iceberg, arrow, ADBC, data fusion, etc. These are technologies that are making data tools more interoperable and standardized which is what open here refers to.—-So back to my point: The majority of the disagreement here comes from how people are defining “open.” This doesn’t mean open source. If you pay attention to the current developments, it’s about open standards and moving away from “proprietary interfaces” to tools and formats that can talk to one another and in general, enable much more efficient data transfer. These two alone unlock many downstream applications!As a small example: warehouses bundled storage, compute, and proprietary file formats together. That’s where the lock-in came from. If your data lived inside a proprietary format (like in Snowflake), you were effectively tied to that engine.The thing that’s really exciting and evolving is the maturation of standardized components of technological primitives that many modern tools use today. Open table formats like iveberg and delta, arrow (as a shared in-memory format), ABDC for super fast data transfer ,and newer engines like duckdb and data fusion all are working towards the same future. They’re all open source, want to converge to open standards, and if used together, enable an “open data infrastructure”. Which means the engine you use for AI/ML, real-time applications, and BI can all be based on data that lives in one storage layer and yet, can be run in any compute engine. Developers can live in a world where you can work towards running local dev in DuckDB and prod workloads in Snowflake. Minimizing vendor lock-in to me is just the a small side-benefit.Vendors are still vendors. Nothing about this means tools like Fivetran+dbt are suddenly open source. The idea is that they operate on top of this new infrastructure that is less restrictive than the old warehouse model for the technological benefits, but also allows them to compete with Snowflake/Databricks/etc at a completely different angle. If engines are swappable, these big platforms lose a lot of their architectural leverage. Now the power and thing to control is the stuff outside of that (I will let you think through that part as an exercise haha). All of this to say, I try not to take anything with face value. There’s always nuance. Yes “open data infra” is a buzz word and is marketing for sure, but if you follow the current state of technology, there’s real nuance here!",muneriver,2026-02-06 22:41:17,8,dataengineering,t3_1qxhzhs,False,

o3hzkxd,"Did that move about 3 years ago, can share my 2 cents.Why I switched: I realized the parts of DE I enjoyed most were modeling data for analysts, arguing about metrics definitions, and making dashboards actually useful. I cared less about perfect infra and more about “are people making better decisions with this.” Analytics engineering was basically that full time.Day to day difference: as a DE I spent a lot of time on infra, pipelines, performance, random firefighting. As an AE I’m still writing SQL and some Python, but I’m way closer to the business. More time on dbt models, tests, documentation, semantic layers, and collaborating with PMs / analysts. Less Kafka / Spark / k8s, more “what does ‘active user’ actually mean and can we stop changing it every quarter.”Step up or step down: it’s more of a fork than a ladder. If you like infra and scale problems, AE will feel softer. If you like modeling, metrics, and being involved in product / strategy chats, it feels like a step up because your impact is easier to see. Comp for me stayed roughly the same, slightly higher later because I became the “metrics owner” and that’s valuable at product‑led companies.Branding / career path: I brand myself as “data platform + analytics” now. Titles I see after AE: senior AE, analytics lead, data product manager, head of data, sometimes even PM for data products. You become a good candidate for roles where you’re the bridge between pure engineering and pure analytics.Gotchas:You will write a lot of SQL and stakeholder‑friendly docs.You’ll spend more time in meetings explaining data than tuning clusters.If you hate ambiguity and politics around definitions, it can be frustrating.With 8 years as DE you’re probably overqualified on the tech side. The real question is whether you want to move closer to the business and be judged more on clarity, communication and “does this metric make sense” than on how elegant your pipeline is.

o3qseyz,"We do both. We make inline documentation and also we generate documentation for dbt models using LLM. In our case we use Cline or Claude Code. We have a specific workflow for each type of model that the LLM follows to generate the docs. Moreover, we instruct the LLM to produce the same structure of documentation for each type of model.For example, curated (mart/gold etc.) models are directed more for the end user and contain sections such as purpose, business use cases, metrics ect. So not too technical. Intermediate models ,i.e., models used to split up complex transformation logic are documented with the developers as an audience, so they are much more technical and basically explain what we are doing CTE by CTE.For most models #Business Logic is a section where we explain the specific business logic/rules implemented. The LLM infers these business logic by lopking both at the RAW query and inline comments. Also if it detects a business logic from a query, we instruct it to add short inline comments explaining it. So it goes both ways.Using LLM to generate documentation increases the doc coverage in our project and increases the uniformity of documentation structure across all models. In turn this documentation is then indeed used to power AI Agents for Data Discovery - think chatting with agents to discover which/where data is stored to answer specific request, so they don't answer the question, they just point the user to where they can probably find their answer. It may be also a documented exposure, not model per se.

I'd like to ask a little bit of clarification.ACCOUNT\_CODE and SERVICE are the two main tables (with several attributes), and they will be kept separate in any model. My two issues are: \- Where and how to store the attribute account\_code x service (which has a 1:N relationship): 3NF, Denormalized, Bridge Table, i2b2 model... \- How to join this information for reporting (e.g. at the SQL level as a table, as a view, or at the reporting level with Tableau Custom SQL or functions)All of the models listed have a single pre-joined table other than A. B connects each account code to the service, but then the aggregation has to be done at the reporting level (in this case, Tableau). I'm sensing that you'd recommend D (denormalized), in which in the service table, there's a column with the grouped account codes (e.g. Service B - 1-3101, 1-3102, 1-3140) and there's a bridge table that connect these groups with the individual account codes.

There is still the potential for that ""aha"" moment when using LLMs - namely, when realising that your question is not being answered correctly, or that the reason nothing it suggests allows you to proceed past some point in a process you're stuck at is because the LLM itself is stuck, on some false assumption.

Which is true but it's also the least interesting reason they exist.Think of it like this. Right now with functions, you're passing data around like handing a folder to different people in an office. ""Here, calculate this."" ""Here, validate that."" Works fine. But the folder doesn't know anything about itself. If you change what's in the folder, every function that touches it might break and you won't know until it does.A class is giving the folder a brain. It knows what's inside it, knows what you're allowed to do with it, and can refuse things that don't make sense.Now that's great and all but let's think about this from a real world problem... say you have three types of reports. With just functions you end up writing process_sales_report(), process_inventory_report(), process_hr_report(), duplicating logic every time. With a class you define what a Report is once (it has data, it can be processed, it can be exported) and each type just fills in its own specifics. You swap behavior without rewriting structure.The honest answer to ""when do I actually need them"" is probably not for small scripts. But the moment you have two things that are similar but not identical and you're copying functions and changing variable names, that's the signal. You're doing manually what a class would do for you.I almost use classes religiously with the pydantic library when I'm building large machine learning or agentic systems, makes life ten times easier.

It made sense to have a class for reading the entire file, and another class for reading a single line - of course nowadays you could just read the entire file into an array of strings, and then have a single function to split each string, but back then it made sense to me :)But again, classes are just a way of structuring your code differently - the ""problem"" it solves is in how programmers organize code, not in anything the code does.",peterlinddk,2026-02-07 15:22:10,3,learnprogramming,t3_1qyg54i,False,

You will understand better once you have spent a year re-writing, re-writing and re-writing either your or someone else's code.ANOTHER VIEWLets say you wrote something to track prices on Amazon. There is a lot of setup, saving of files, formatting a report/GUI & overhead to a script that does this.You get it working and it's great.Then - someone says ""Make it work against Timu"" or eBay or some other shopping site.If you wrote linear functions - all the special code that deals with how Amazon displays & stores things is all throughout the code. It takes days or weeks to find all the spots in the code to convert to Timu.But if you had used a class to deal with Amazon - all the logic to deal with the Amazon web site is in a single class. It probably has 7-20 methods. You now have 2 choices:* Copy the Amazon class to create a Timu class and start changing things.* Get fancy and create a base 'website' class. Get the Amazon version working then get the Timu/Ebay version working.Either approach will let you modify your code to do something new a lot faster than if you wrote the original with nested functions.IMPORTANT: This higher-level design of your scripts comes from experience. You can totally use AI to help - but a human must look at the problem and decide how to structure the system. This is the difference between ""Design"" vs ""Implementation"".

o445nem,"> Struggling to see the point of classesDon't overthink OOP. Classes are just a different way of looking at code and data.> I end up solving everything with functions. Functions call other functions, and the project works fine.Great that is exactly how any program work. There is no other way actually. The difference is how you look at functions together with data. You may actually code in an OOP style without ceating any classes at all. It all depends on what functions use what data. If you pack a set of functions together with a set of data and limit other functions from this data then you're basically coding in an OOP style.> If functions get the job done, what problem are classes really solving?Classes are useful because they tie data and code together in a very visible and safe way. With a class you can create a group of data and functions that work together and you can protect the data from changes from other functions outside of the class. You can also make the data work as one unit or object and tie operators to the object making it easier to use. This may seem trivial in a small program but in a large program with hundreds of files you can isolate the use of data and you don't need to check all files for usage.> This has become a big hurdle for me because almost every take home assessment or practice project I see either requires or strongly expects the use of classes, and I just can’t seem to wrap my head around how or where they fit.This is not difficult. Just look at the problem from a data point of view. What information is needed and belongs together. This pack of data is a class. What relations does the data have with other data. How many of each are there. What changes to the data is needed, these are the functions, or methods in OOP, that take the data as one parameter.Hope this helps you on the way.",Sbsbg,2026-02-07 17:49:58,3,learnprogramming,t3_1qyg54i,False,

o3edbt8,"First, domain names are like file paths, just backwards. Instead of /foo/bar/baz/folder/myfile, you have myrecord.domain.baz.bar.foo. The domain name 9gag.com is registered as living on a set of nameservers that the folks at 9gag control, and they can put as many records there with as many levels of dots as they like (up to the limits of the system, which maxes out at 255 characters for a full domain and at most 63 characters between dots).Second, the Internet predates the Web. There used to be many different services that a site might want to offer besides HTTP. Like an FTP server with files at ftp.whatever.com, a gopher server at gopher.whatever.com, a mail server at mail.whatever.com, a USENET server at news.whatever.com or nntp.whatever.com. If you were coming from inside whatever.com's network you might hit smtp.whatever.com to send mail and imap.whatever.com to retrieve yours. Back in the day these would likely have actually been different physical computers. And in that world, www.whatever.com was just another service - ""www"" for ""World-Wide Web"".But it did not take long for the Web to take over the Internet, after which pretty much everything else took a back seat to it. The web was everyone's ""front door"", so they wanted to make it as easy as possible to get to. For that reason, most companies arranged for their top-level domain (""TLD""), when looked up all by itself, to point to their web server's IP address. That way you could just type `whatever.com` into your browser to get there. (Later browsers would add this as a fallback behavior; if you enter 'whatever.com' and it can't find an IP address for that, it will give 'www.whatever.com' a try. But originally it was up to the site owners to make that work.)Rather than just duplicating the web server's IP address record, which could lead to forgetting to change both in the future, the equivalence is usually accomplished by making the ""www"" subdomain an _alias_ for the TLD. (Not the other way around, because the root of a domain can't be an alias for technical reasons.) In the DNS database, the value associated with an alias record is the ""canonical name"" that it is an alias _for_, called a CNAME for short; for that reason, they're also called CNAME records, and sometimes aliases are called CNAMEs, even though that's sort of the opposite of what it means. Anyway, your example is one of those: $ dig +noall +answer www.9gag.com a www.9gag.com. 300 IN CNAME 9gag.com.What that means is that when a computer goes to look up the IP address of ""www.9gag.com"", it gets an answer back saying ""use the address of 9gag.com"". So it has to turn around and look up ""9gag.com"" to get the actual IP address. (Fortunately for the sake of net traffic reduction, when your computer looks it up, your ISP's nameserver has likely already done that for you and just returns both the CNAME and the IP addresses - A records for IPv4, AAAA records for IPv6 - in response to the original query.)",zeekar,2026-02-03 19:46:37,8,learnprogramming,t3_1qus7ht,False,

Every step you cut the possibilities in half, so you find the right point in time in a few minutes rather than having to watch all 8 hours of video. That's a binary search. An index is just a sorted copy, which lets you do a binary search. Without it, the security tape has been cut up and rearranged randomly, so you just have to watch from the beginning and spend 4 hours (on average) to find the thief.

o3sszz2,"That's not bad practice, it's a common and useful pattern.When people say functions are ""first-class objects"" in Python, it just means you can treat functions like any other value. You can assign them to variables, pass them to other functions, or store them in data structures like lists and dictionaries. Not all languages allow this.one clarification is that you're not actually storing the function itself in the dictionary. you're storing a *reference* to it (called a pointer). The function exists once in memory, and the dictionary just holds a way to find it. That's why you write `""start"": start_game` without parentheses, with parentheses you'd be *calling* the function and storing its return value instead.Typical use cases:```python# Command dispatchcommands = { ""start"": start_game, ""quit"": quit_game, ""help"": show_help,}action = commands.get(user_input)if action: action() # Now we call it``````python# Replacing long if/elif chainsdef handle_event(event_type, data): handlers = { ""click"": handle_click, ""submit"": handle_submit, ""load"": handle_load, } handler = handlers.get(event_type, handle_unknown) return handler(data)```This is cleaner than a sprawling if/elif block, easier to extend, and the mapping is explicit. You'll see this pattern in CLI tools, event systems, parsers, and state machines.The only things to watch for is to make sure the functions have compatible signatures if you're calling them uniformly, and don't over-complicate simple cases where a basic `if` would be fine",Eogcloud,2026-02-05 22:30:37,72,learnprogramming,t3_1qwz48z,False,

o49yaqp,"This is one of those opinion based things so people may disagree but here is my list.1. Learn to communicate well! This include written and verbal communications. Frankly in college this was a huge challenge, more difficult than just about all other courses I took. In the corporate world it can be more important than really understanding what you are doing. Yes that is sad.2. Learn to navigate at least two Operating Systems from the command line. This includes multiple tools that these OS'es deliver.3. SCM! Yes git and github are extremely popular these days but in the corporate world you use what they currently have set up. So understand the hows and whys. 4. Docker might not be a thing, in fact there are plenty of jobs that never touch the web. As a programmer you may need to target platform specific applications. So don't dismiss native app development. This Reddit seems to be very web development focused but people need to know there are many jobs where programming skills might be leveraged.5. If you are not doing web development learn the default IDE for the platform you are working on inside out. With modern IDE's this can take as much time as learning Python. This especially with AI integration. So if you are programming a Mac, that means learn XCode, if you are programming a PLC. that might mean RSLogix. 6. Which brings up AI, learn to leverage it as a programmer to improve your productivity. This is entirely different than trying to implement AI features in an application.7. Learn Python even if Python might not be your primary development language.8. Speaking of Python, spend some time with C or C++ at the command line. This should be covered in the first few classes of a good CS program. The reason here is that understanding how compilers, linkers and such, work is important, especially in the future when the IDE breaks. Command line development might not be the norm these days but understanding how an app is built is still required knowledge.9. Keep you math skills up. You may go years not needing a particular math skill in your programming career, then one day somebody asks for a specific statistical result. Yes there are reference manuals and text to refer to but in all honesty rusty algebra can really trip you up. Some people believe mathematical thinking and practice helps keep you programming skill honed, I don't know about that, what I do know is removing rust can really set you behind.10. Someone else mentioned typing, this is actually huge. I literally learned typing in high school well before I could even get access to a computer much less buy one. Yes this was a teenager looking towards his future - shocking. In any event it is a skill that makes the job much easier.11. Take an assembly language course as part of your college education. The point here is not to become an embedded programmer but rather to get insight into how processors work. In the past a good CS program required one quarter of assembly, in that case done on a emulator. These days you could just as easily buy a small microcontroller system and learn there.12. I touched on this above but when it comes to computing systems, the world is much bigger than delivering web apps and in some cases these alternatives pay much better. So don't dismiss these alternative paths in IT that may or may not be programming heavy. Examples: Security, embedded programming, industrial automation, platform apps, network management, compiler development (because most languages suck), interpreter development (because Python has been taken over by mad men), API and SDK development, test and validation, SQL (databases) and so forth. Others can add to this list, ultimately this should be an FAQ someplace. 13. Have a well defined minor. Lets face it programming as a skill by itself is not going to be a huge career driver. Rather it is how you apply those programming skills to solve problems. While a weak example if you are doing web development a minor in business might be a big plus. If you are going to be involved in embedded as stronger background in electronics can be helpful. If you want to work in the optics industry a strong physics background should be considered. Actually a strong physics background can help for many paths in a programming career.There you go a bakers dozen. I suspect the most important point above is to avoid this idea that programming means the web.

This is very important to develop independently, breaking down complex problems into steps computers understand is arguably what programming *is*.Library gaps refer to not knowing specific tools that your language or libraries provide you. You mostly pick these up over time and it's not a big deal to look them up.For example, if you want to convert a string to lowercase, algorithmic thinking tells you that you can iterate through the string, convert each letter (with e.g. ascii code math), and build a new string. You should conceptually be able to write that code in your head in your preferred language, even if you don't type it out. Library knowledge tells you ""in python, you can do string.lower().""Stackoverflow (and docs) is good for learning library knowledge. As you build more library knowledge in a language, it translates to having an easier time thinking algorithmically in that language.",etoastie,2026-02-04 08:27:13,15,learnprogramming,t3_1qviwo1,False,

o3l8sjs,"There are tons of ways to learn and everyone has different starting points.If you are brand new, looking at code and figuring out how it interacts with other code is really great at forming the understanding of how data points are processed and how different data types interact. This will build familiarity, but won't build problem solving skills.Once you have the gist of how and why some functions work, start learning the terminology. This is arguably one of the stronger skills you will need in the age of AI. Knowing exactly what to look for or how to phrase the parts you are stuck on will help immensely.Problem solving skills are the top priority skills for all programmers. The ONLY way to build this is with practice. Projects are great ways to practice breaking down big problems into tiny problems. If you need to practice tiny problems, chug away at LeetCode, HackerRank, or other platforms that can present a problem to you and give you instant feedback on if your solution is acceptable.All projects/apps/features boild down to this line of thinking: ""how do I break this problem down into chunks that I can work with?""I generally have a rough idea of what the end-project looks like, then I split that project into milestones, then I keep splitting each milestone into smaller parts until I find a place to start building out everything within the milestone. If your milestones are independent of one another, you can rotate which parts of the project to do if you get stuck and don't want to burn out. If one milestone depends on another, you gotta finish all of the first one before you can work on the second one.All project structures will be different.

Usually the ""right"" way to solve something either won't exist or won't be evident until after you have tried a bunch of different things.

There is far too much technical documentation for anyone to fully memorize. If you need something done quick, look for shortcuts or similar completed projects. If you have time to learn, deliberately practice your problem solving when you get stuck instead of looking up an answer right away.

Today after I figure how or what the structure of the program should be, I sit down and just type. Most times I don't think about the code and somehow like magic, my fingers just type away.

It somehow just worked out that I was going to need it and can now type words out as fast as someone can talk. Learning computer language after computer language can also be really difficult. But what amazed me is the structured process of learning another spoken language. Classes always start with ""Who, What, When, Where, Why and How"".

I can survive speaking German on the basic level and I know enough Mandarin to order in a restaurant. All computer languages have the same basics as spoken languages. If, do, while, loop, for, next, with a majority of languages also having a switch statement or something similar. If you can get those procedures down, learning another computer language becomes so much more easier. It also makes fitting a square plug in a round hole so much more easier in a different computer language you may not be familiar with.So, don't spend that much time concentrating on the actual computer language and concentrate on problem solving to use the language you are currently working with.And if anyone really wants to know, when I sleep at night I dream in C#.",HobbesArchive,2026-02-05 03:18:44,2,learnprogramming,t3_1qviwo1,False,

You end up wiring libraries together without understanding failure modes, limits, or trade-offs. That is not machine learning competence.Start by separating Python from machine learning. Python is a tool. Machine learning is applied mathematics.First phase: foundations.You need linear algebra (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues), calculus (derivatives, partial derivatives, gradients), probability (distributions, expectation, variance), and statistics (hypothesis testing, bias/variance). Without these, concepts like gradient descent, regularization, overfitting, or loss functions are opaque symbols. Use textbooks, not shortcut videos. Expect months, not weeks.Second phase: Python as a numerical language.Learn Python only to the level needed to express math. Focus on:Core syntax, functions, loops, list/dict comprehensionsNumPy for vectorized computationMatplotlib for visualising functions and error surfacesIgnore ""Python for ML in 10 hours"" content. It trains imitation, not understanding.Third phase: machine learning from first principles.Before touching scikit-learn, implement algorithms yourself:Linear regression from scratchGradient descent manuallyLogistic regression with your own loss functionk-means without librariesIf you cannot derive the update rule on paper, you are not ready to code it.Fourth phase: libraries.Only after the above should you use scikit-learn, PyTorch, or TensorFlow. At this point libraries accelerate work rather than replace thinking. You should be able to predict model behaviour before running it.Rules to follow:Avoid tutorial playlists that jump straight to neural networksPrefer courses that derive equations before codeIf math feels uncomfortable, that is the signal you are on the right pathExpect frustration; ML is not a ""learn a library"" skillBottom line:Machine learning is mathematics implemented in Python.

o3dsomh,"The nature of Undefined Behavior is that the compiler - most of the time, can't prove an error; therefore, the spec says it's up to you personally to make sure the code is correct. The BEST we can do is SOMETIMES detect SOME cases of UB and emit a warning.There's an insidious nature to UB - no one can define it. Signed integer overflow is often well defined on hardware, that doesn't mean the C++ spec or the compiler gets to defer to the hardware. It's still undefined behavior. In fact, UB allows a compiler to optimize very aggressively. If, for example, you overflowed, you cannot reliably detect you've overflowed. You might think hey - just see if an increment of a positive results in a negative. But the compiler KNOWS overflow ""cannot"" happen, so it can correctly optimize the ""obviously"" impossible check out, and code paths that presume overflow didn't happen get a negative value anyway.Thus is the nature of UB. You're not going to win against the compiler's CORRECT assumptions that you're NOT going to fuck around with UB. And you don't know how the compiler is going to act upon those assumptions at any given time. Believe it or not, compilation itself is not inherently deterministic.Further, you may not even get consistent behaviors between program runs, or even while the program is running. And once UB has been evaluated at runtime, you cannot rely on what the program is going to do afterward.UB is to be respected. Your x64 or Apple M may be robust, but UB is what bricks a Nintendo DS, most famously when glitch hacking Pokemon or Zelda; you end up accessing an invalid bit pattern that fries some circuits in the ARM5 core.A lot of engineers are incorrectly dismissive of UB. These engineers would NEVER get a job working on critical systems, where that attitude is going to get a people killed, cause billions in damages, or cause unrecoverable losses.I hear the attitude - ""We're not saving lives, here..."" Yeah? You wanna diminish your company and it's product more? Do that in front of the CEO. You might not be saving lives with every product, but to be dismissive is also putting the revenue streams and the reputation of the company at risk. No one wants to hear it.

It can also be a good idea to limit leakage of implementation details such models (errors, responses etc) of your internal dependencies.On a final note, when planning and writing code it's good to think about future extensions of that code. Writing complicated abstractions to support future possible functionality is usually a bad idea, but just thinking about how a current solution would hold up in the future can be helpful.

Having the bulk of your functions be side-effect free2. Using immutable data structures (e.g. don't modify your dicts/lists/dataclasses after they're created)...would be a good fit for the more pipeline-oriented nature of your task. You have data you're slicing and dicing, and want some reasonable assurances that each 'transform' or 'analysis' function you have in your script is self-contained and bug-free. Having a clean divide between IO code vs business logic and keeping mutation to a minimum are two good ways of helping you do this.The OOP paradigm is usually more useful when it's important you maintain certain 'invariants' around data: things like 'my data structure must always respect this property, no matter how it's modified' or 'all interactions with this particular 3rd party API must include these magic headers'. If you have a lot of these fiddly rules to manage, it can often be convenient to create a class that wraps around your data and presents a cleaner interface to the outside world.But I think this sort of need is rare in data-slicing or 'pipeline' style programs.Note that this sort of decision-making has nothing to do if you're writing a script or not. I've written short 100-line scripts that ended up making heavy use of OOP, and longer 5k-10k LOC production-ready services that used it very sparingly. My ultimate goal is to make the code as obviously correct as possible (which in turn makes it both easy to understand and modify). Sometimes objects can help with this, other times they won't.That is, OOP is not the same thing as 'clean code'.

SWE best practices, I would look into:1. Writing tests and perhaps even a CI/CD pipeline for your scripts, starting with the more business critical / frequently run and modified ones. If people are actively making business decisions based on some of your analysis, you'd want reasonable confidence it indeeds behaves as expected. 2. Creating and popularizing a helper library that streamlines common operations. The goal here is to speed up the time it takes to author a new pipeline.I don't know anything about your company, but I'd imagine both correctness and speed-of-delivery are two factors that matter most to your team and your bosses.

You will probably get more targeted answers in data engineering or data science subreddits.For starters, I would try using something that can translate between notebooks and .py files like jupytext. Would make source control and other checks a lot easier.Based on what you have said, traditional unit tests are often difficult to apply here and tend to provide less value in data workflows than people expect. I would focus more on testing the output instead. Things like row counts, nulls, ranges, schema changes, distribution shifts, and data freshness usually catch issues much earlier.A lot of the unit test advice you are getting is common in app and web development, where the failure modes are different. In data, things usually break because the shape or semantics of the data change, not because someone touched the code.As far as OOP is concerned, you are less likely to run into it in many data jobs. It becomes important when dealing with graphs or hierarchies. Otherwise it is mostly useful for providing structure.Generally, anywhere you are passing a lot of variables to a function or manipulating large dicts, you will probably want to turn those into a dataclass. For external boundaries like configs, inputs, or outputs, use pydantic. Use type hints everywhere, and use a linter and code formatter as well.

I’ve done a lot better focusing on procedural, data driven, or functional programming designs. That isn’t to say that OOP doesn’t have its place. But lately I’ve had a lot more success waiting until the last possible moment to start using it. Like when my program is basically working, but I’m getting tired of passing around long lists of parameters, or a function seems to be tightly coupled to particular set of data. Only then will I introduce objects, and if my code suddenly feels cleaner and easier, then I know it is helping and not hurting my codebase. And usually I only end up needing a few objects here and there. Anyway, I think it’s still worth practicing OOP, but don’t feel obligated to use it everywhere.

o3hi9ru,"Oop is often a mess, so are scripts…Oop adds complexity, while only adding little organisation…There are 2 big paradigms in programming: imperative vs declarative aka you tell the machine how to do sth vs you tell the machine what to do.Oop, as well as procedural (scripting is mostly procedural) are imperative. Oop just means to group together data as objects with functions for those objects (originally without state, but today state is the center of oop -> state is probably the biggest cause of bugs, given that you test your code)Declarative programming is functional programming, reactive programming or logic programming. All similar, but for fp: you describe a function with other functions, to do that, you write functions that create functions and take functions as parameters, there is no state and a function only does one thing with one parameter… for example in procedural programming adding 2 numbers is done with a function like this: add = (a,b) => a+b Functional programming is a bit different, you have a function returning a function: add = a => b => a+b So, looks a bit unnecessary at first, but you can use functions to build functions… you can do: inc = add (1), while procedural would need a inc (a) => a+1. Increasing the items in a list is also easy: newList = oldList.map(add(1)), in procedural, you would loop over the list, getting every item, adding 1 and then pushing it in a new list. And oop would have a class inheriting from list, then have some build method that then changes the internal state to transform itself. (Yeah, there is a reason people mix paradigms)There are also other paradigms, like concurrent programming (lots of data and shared resources), constraint programming, dataflow programming (aka forced recalculation hell), metaprogramming (manipulating code, instead of data… extremely powerful, easy to fuck up, hell to debug and only really useful, if you know exactly what you are doing) and there is also pipeline programming -> build pipelines…And a few others… but yeah, can recommend functional programming within oop, so constants instead of state and single param functions, as well as higher order functions",ExtraTNT,2026-02-04 06:15:39,1,learnprogramming,t3_1qv8oap,False,

That usually leads to frustration because you recognize solutions when you see them but cannot reproduce them later.A simple structure that works well is learning one pattern at a time. Study the core idea, solve a few easy and medium problems, then come back later and try to rebuild the solution from memory. That last step is where most actual learning happens.If you are transitioning from a service company, consistency matters more than speed. Two focused hours daily with review and recall usually beats long random grinding sessions.I built a small platform called [algodrill.io](http://algodrill.io) after mentoring people making this same transition.

It can make a big difference on how you solve these, but just pick whatever language is actually relevant to the kinds of jobs are interested in, so you're not spreading yourself thin for no good reason.I don't have an opinion on the resources you mentioned. What they're mainly good for is narrowing, say, the entire leetcode problem set down to a _much_ smaller subset that gives you a focused sampling of the major problem types. There are more problems on leetcode.com than a sane person has time for or need for, and there's a lot of overlap between many leetcode problems, so you want to avoid aimlessly meandering there and treating leetcode.com as the roadmap. * Start with easy problems only. * Gradually build up your toolkit of data structures so you learn when to apply certain data structures to which kinds of situations, and exposure to issues that can arise when writing code (off-by-one, index or boundary issues, logic errors, proper handling of numbers, concurrent modification issues, reference vs value, mutability issues, etc.)* Some ""easy"" problems may seem hard, and it may not be your fault * IIRC some leetcode problems were mislabeled, and may still be? Those sites that give you a more curated list might help avoid this issue? Anyway, I'd avoid picking random problems directly from leetcode.com itself.* Work on problems one at a time, give them a fair shot, but don't waste inordinate amounts of time being stuck. * Force yourself to think and use the tools you can recall. If you can't solve a problem in a reasonable time because you're simply missing the tools needed to solve it, then just look up and study well-written, non-code-golfed solutions, understand the key pieces, and move on. And plan to revisit those problems later on (put them at the back of your problem queue). Over time your recall of the problem -> solution mappings will strengthen.* Always be putting your solution (and test cases) in its own file that you can _run_ on your machine. * e.g. `node leetcode1-twosum.js`. You can also use a debugger, e.g. `node --inspect-brk leetcode1-twosum.js` when you run into problems.* Try not to see DSA as an isolated thing. * The main thing it boils down to is picking the right data structure(s) that suit the problem and help you meet the requirements, whatever they are. * A hard part is these problems can feel contrived and disconnected, which may be true, or may be an illusion - it depends. There's no one way to feel about it. I'm still deeply affected by having learned the ""text justification"" DP problem, and nobody can take from me. * Try to come to your own conclusions about the need/value of studying DSA problems based on the kinds of companies you're interested in. Feeling bad about this interview style is a common feeling, but not necessarily a useful feeling, depending on what you're after.* Timebox your DSA study so that you can make time for other things * Mostly to make sure you're spending time working on actual projects, so you're slowly getting exposure there. * Personal projects can give you freedom to try things that may be difficult to justify trying at work, and which can have very high learning/growth value. * Some experience solving DSA problems can benefit your implementations a bit, but won't help you learn how to design systems. So they can be complementary.For advice moving from a service-oriented to a product company...* if your current job has lots of greenfield projects with a short lifecycle, take advantage of that as a catalyst for growth, and as freedom to try slightly different approaches and to learn from past mistakes in code design. * Once you move to a product company, that can be less common. It can still happen, e.g. starting new products, or somewhat isolated subprojects or tools, etc. that serve the overall product in whatever way. But a lot of your time will be spent on things you may not be able to change easily.* Don't overly aggrandize product companies and don't belittle yourself and the time you're spending right now. * Have a mentality that your time right now is preparation for what's to come.* In your current job, try to be curious and thinking about your own growth. * If you have some decision-making power over which technologies or approaches are used, try to carve out a little space for yourself to grow, whatever that means. Try to keep it low-risk (don't put projects at risk due to making wild choices, but try to take whatever liberties you can that help you move in the direction of writing better code and making better overall system design choices that meet the requirements of the project). * If you don't have that power yet, then try to keep growing your skills and becoming so good that companies feel compelled to put you in that position and let you take the lead on things.* Prep for interviews, but don't wait too long to jump into the fray. * Usually interviews don't give good (or any) direct feedback, but ideally you have a rough sense of what you did well or not so well, and figure out what to work on. Dwelling on the asymmetry of the interview process won't help you, it is what it is.* Don't be too surprised when interviews don't go well * Just move right along to the next one, and don't get discouraged by the process. * Try to glean whatever you can, and cross-reference how you did with how others do, e.g. watch videos of mock interviews if useful. See what they do well and think about what you didn't do as well.* Ask your interviewers directly what you can do better!!! * Don't leave this up to HR to do (they won't). * Your fellow programmers _might_ be willing to say _something_ when asked directly at the very end. Don't be surprised if some cop out of this, but not all will. Either way, it's better than not asking and then getting absolutely 0 on the tail end.* Make sure to express interest in the company and product/problem domain. * When the interview ends with Q&A, be sure to have at least a couple questions about the team and/or company!! It can tip the scales in your favor a bit.* Don't automatically assume rejections are because you're bad. * Sometimes the company just has to pick between multiple people, and you may have been good but not _as_ good as somebody else. Well, what happens if that person gets hit by a bus, or quits, or whatever.

o3jpfx2,"With an EE background, your career path matters more than the language itself. Here's the practical breakdown: If you want to stay close to hardware (embedded systems, robotics, IoT, firmware) - start with C. It maps directly to how you already think about registers, memory, and hardware. Arduino uses C++ technically, but in a very C-like way. The embedded industry still runs on C and will for decades. Companies like Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and automotive firms want C + understanding of hardware, which is exactly your combo. If you want to pivot toward software engineering at a tech company - C++ is the better resume play. It's used heavily in game engines, high-frequency trading, operating systems, and performance-critical applications. But honestly? For most software engineering roles at tech companies, Python (which you already know) plus a web language would get you further than either C or C++. The real answer nobody's telling you: your EE degree + programming is a rare and valuable combination. Don't think of it as ""learning to code from scratch."" Companies building physical products with software components (robotics, autonomous vehicles, medical devices, consumer electronics) specifically seek people who understand both sides. That's a much less crowded job market than pure software dev. Start with C on Arduino since you're excited about it. Motivation beats optimization every time when you're learning.

Assuming that this is Java, don't concatenate a lot of small strings. Strings are immutable in Java, so you are creating a copy every time you do `string0 += string1`.

o3chysa,"I don’t know about Dart, but in many languages it’s possible (or sometimes required) to override an object’s hash code function, so (contrary to some comments here) it’s important to understand how they work.No, hash collisions are possible. They’re even quite likely if a developer has written a bad hashing function on their object. Assuming everything else in the system is written correctly, these bad hashing functions will impact efficiency but not correctness.Comparing two objects for pointer equality is generally very cheap, and this is what `==` does in most languages. “Pointer equality” means that the objects are in identical memory locations (whether on the machine or on a VM; the details are complicated but not relevant right now.) This means the objects are really and truly “the same”; if you mutate one, the other will be mutated as well, because they’re the same object.Comparing two object’s hash codes is frequently cheap, but not as cheap as pointer equality, because hash codes are often highly optimized and frequently cacheable. If the compiler/runtime knows that the object hasn’t changed since the last time you’ve computed its hash, it can choose to reuse the result of the last hashing operation instead of running it again.Comparing two objects for value equality can be expensive. “Value equality” means that the objects are conceptually the same. For nested objects, this generally means walking the whole object graph and comparing each piece of data in both objects to each other. For small objects this is cheap, for big objects it might not be. Value equality is a conceptually stronger guarantee than pointer equality, because it tells you that two objects “mean” the same thing, even if they were constructed at different locations. However, this can be fragile in the presence of mutability, because if you mutate one of the objects they might stop being equal.If you want to check whether two objects have value equality, usually you do this:1. Check whether the objects have pointer equality. If they do, the objects are equal and you’re done. Pointer equality implies value equality. 2. Check whether the objects have hash code equality. If they don’t, then they are unequal, and you’re done. Hash code inequality implies value inequality. 3. As a last resort, check whether the objects have value equality. Hash codes are especially necessary as a performance optimization when using objects in collections which have limitations around item equality. `Set` and `Map`/`Dictionary` are the main ones which come to mind. In a set you don’t want there to be multiple copies of objects which are equal to each other, and in a dictionary you don’t want to add duplicate keys. In both of these situations you’re not just comparing two objects for equality, you’re comparing one object to a whole bunch of objects and seeing if it’s equal to any of them. In a big collection, this would get more expensive as the collection gets bigger. Without hash codes, adding N items to a set is an O(N^2) operation. So the way these data structures are usually implemented is by using “buckets” of items which have hash codes in a given range. When you want to add an object, the data structure computes its hash code, then finds the bucket which it belongs to (an `O(M)` operation, where `M` is the number of buckets, or in some cases `O(1)`, depending on the implementation). Then, if there’s already items in the bucket, the object being added is compared to every item in that bucket until an equal object is found. (`O(N)`, for a much smaller `N` than before). All in all this is asymptotically much, much faster.Of course, as I alluded to earlier, mutability messes this whole thing up. If you mutate an object in a way that would change its hash code then the algorithm used by the data structure will no longer perform correctly and it will be left in an invalid state.Hopefully this helps.

There usually are several paths that lead to the goal. Some are more efficient than others, some are better readable/maintainable than others, and some are good middle-grounds between efficiency and readability/maintainability - that's the ones a programmer should strive for. If your solution is super intelligent and efficient but you are the only one who understands it, it is useless in production, but may be nice for competitions, if your solution is super slow but extremely readable, you're on the other end of the scale and should work on your speed.It's all a matter of experience.

Being well-rounded makes is a good skill for connecting with people too.Plus being able to create art you want, even if only as a hobby, is just a good skill. I do programming, a little bit of traditional arts, and digital arts as hobbies and the intersection of them is damn fun. I enjoy being able to draw/create whatever workflow. I quite enjoy employing common algorithms in interesting ways \[re: not LLM/AI stuff as that wasn't around!\]; I get to pursue a much wider variety of workflows/techniques since I can draw on a wider skillset.Learning how to paint, the mixtures, pigments, etc \[I got quite into paint this last year\] has really taught me the details of finishing, coating, and protecting anything I may make - from furniture to housing. And a quick coat of paint can make a used, cheap piece look brand new!Plus I find learning both digital and traditional art reinforces the core skills one needs to make good art overall. Composition, colors, lighting, texture, detail density, etc - all necessary to practice regardless of the medium.What's the point of being a programmer if you don't also get a bit of time to pursue other topics that you enjoy? I think it's worthwhile to read history, but I can tell you it will not be getting me raises anytime soon!Lastly, when you learn things, it may open doors you previously would not have been aware of. The twists of life might open a door or two that would've been hidden otherwise.Finally, the AI stuff concerning \*making\* art is such a strong debate I think all the noise around it always misses the forest for the big tree. Thinking on it, however, one faces the same core issues with generative tools as you did with old school algorithmic/digital art!Say my 200x200 random pixel generator is able to theoretically produce any piece of art ever. (any piece in a 200x200 space of course) The problem is, statistically, most art produced is random noise. It's all \*seems\* the same - despite both pieces of noise being very different in terms of data - because both noises communicate the same exact thing to the audience. ""This is random noise"".IMO, to make impactful art, you've\- You've got to understand why and which elements evoke what you want in the audience. \- You've got to understand what is important, what isn't, and tightly control what is important. \- And generate interesting ideas within the work of any sort.The first two require lots of practice and is a soft skill - much like cooking w/o a recipe. The last one, I find, is much easier when I pore over an artwork and let the creative process compound on itself. (And study lots of extraneous subjects or other artworks to pull more ideas from!)Much like you've got to learn how to draw your basics before you can start breaking the rules, I think the biggest problem AI presents is it can undercut the learning process, development of personal styles, & creative process. Much like if you only ever followed ""paint by numbers"" kits and never challenged yourself further.\[Though once you've got your art down, and you find it has a useful part in your workflow, I figure it becomes a tool like any other -- IP issues not withstanding. Albeit I'm cantankerous and refuse to give up any control to blackboxes : P. And can't really see how'd I use it in a way that isn't covered by photobashing & art archives ha!

o3bfxq4,"Everything is normal - a lot of people like to confuse things further by talking about passing by reference or value or copying, etc. This usually only confuses things further.Let me try to show an example - first with an integer (code isn't Dart or anything in particular, mostly pseudocode): int v1 = 5; // first we declare a variable 'v1' with a value of '5' myFunc(v1); // then we send that variable as an argument to the function def myFunc( v2 ) { // in the function, the variable 'v2' is now also set to the value '5' print( v2 ) // as we can see if we print it v2 = 4; // but then we change 'v2' to '4' // 'v1' was never changed }Then if we use lists - the result is actually exactly the same: list l1 = ['c','a','t']; // we declare a list 'l1' with 'c','a' and 't' myListFunc( l1 ); // then we send that list as an argument to the function def myListFunc( l2 ) { // in that function, the variable 'l2' is now set to the same list // of 'c','a','t' print( l2 ); // as we can see if we print it l2 = ['d','o','g']; // but when we change 'l2' to another list of 'd','o','g' // the original 'l1' was never changed }Some people like to argue that 'v2' becomes a copy of 'v1' but 'l2' becomes a reference to 'l1' - this isn't entirely correct, and in my opinion only muddies the water. The important thing is that when you set a variable = some other value, it doesn't matter where it originally got its value from, it is gone. And setting v2 = v1 doesn't ""link"" v2 and v1 in any way, it just makes them have the same value.Now for the tricky part!A value like 4 and 5 cannot be changed, setting v1 to 5 and then setting v2 to v1 and v2 to 4, does not change neither 4 nor 5, it only changes the variables v1 and v2.But a *value* like a list, **can be changed**, you can replace individual items, add or remove them - it is still the same list. You cannot replace or remove anything in the number 5.So this code does change the inside of l1: list l1 = ['c','a','t']; // we declare a list 'l1' with 'c','a' and 't' myOtherListFunc( l1 ); // then we send that list as an argument to the new function def myOtherListFun( l2 ) { // and receive the same list as variable 'l2' l2.add('s'); // and we modify the inside of the list! // this has also changed the list for 'l1' because it is the same list }There's nothing magic about it - note that we don't write `l2 = ['c','a','t','s']` because that would change l2 to be another list, just like v2 was changed to be another number.If we could write `v2.increment()` or something like that, we would be able to change v1 through v2, but as that is usually not the case in most languages, programmers like to say that numbers are copied and lists are referenced - although it rarely is like that.",peterlinddk,2026-02-03 10:04:58,1,learnprogramming,t3_1quc0t2,False,

So if you want to be an expert, you need to pick a field and master it. You can still have a good understanding of surrounding domains and basic knowledge of things further afield, but you need to focus on specific areas to become an expert.For example, lets say you want to become an expert in large data stores for corporations. That means being an expert in databases, accesses methods, scaling and many more things. But it is also useful to understand access methodologies such as Enterprise servers and how they operate. This can contribute to making decisions like performing processing in database (using complex SQL, procedures or maybe even UDFs) or do that processing in the server but requiring multiple fetches to the database. On the other hand, it is still useful, but far less so, to understand the front end technologies and their supporting services.So, what I am saying is pick something (or a small number of related things) and learn them well, but also identify the main things that surround them and be well aware of them.

I understood memory management very well at a conceptual level - specifically the heap and the stack.

If you don't you've just been given a guide on what to learn next. You research a bit and learn about privileges and using the sudo command. You research a bit more and you learn that dnf is your package manager and why it makes your life easier.Now tomorrow you decide you want to talk to friends on Discord, you already probably can guess how to do it, but just in case you can google how to download the Linux version.

That should be an itch you scratch, and of you look around you'll discover that you can kill that process by hitting ctrl+c. Ever try to paste something in the terminal and it doesnt work?

You thus use a setter that has validation built in so you can't set it to whatever you like. Later you then prevent yourself (or someone else) from accidentally writing an incorrect or impossible value. 2. Keeping code lean:Sometimes variables might only be internally used in the class. I might not need to know specific information, in those cases just setting the variable private prevents it from showing up in your IDE and or documentation, keeping things leaner3. Magic numbers: Magic numbers (or magic strings) are plain numbers in your code. Say you want to give a spefic tag or ID to something, and you write 'var = 5;'. The '5' could be turned into a variable and made private. This to reduce magic numbers, and allow easier modification later. (hand in hand with #2) 4.

You could create a helper function to do the filtering everywhere the Getter is used, but you run the chance of someone forgetting. The better solution is to handle it in the Getter itself.

It does stink when it feels like you have a non bias system of evaluation you've applied and then it's updated under you.What I do in this situation is try to keep the feedback details the same as much as possible, remove any references to the specific rating (like, Surpasses Expectations vs Meets) in the feedback. I give them all the factual situations and behaviors that lead me to rate them this way. I walk them through how the company evaluates performance (if it is documented by the company), how I apply those criteria in my own evaluations and aligns those evaluations across managers. This is good feedback for the employee, the things they are doing well keep doing, the things they may want to change, maybe they want to change them, and so on. Did they get peer feedback? Do you have impressions of their work? all great to share. It's hard when they people you manage are asking for specific feedback to get to the rating they want.

One thing I can tell you from your post is, stop trying so hard to chase the next level. I have seen this trap from so many different people (my self included), from juniors to staff+. I have seen people get bitter and go “I’m doing the same work as this other person, why I’m I X and they’re X+1?” But almost always, there is something that is really holding them back. I worked with one mid level once who was extremely bitter that they were not promoted to sr yet (the left amazon as a sde1 or 2, applied as a sr to my current company under the impression that they’d get promoted to sr quickly, and then quit 3 years later as still a midlevel). They were extremely difficult to work with honestly, and mostly because of that bitterness. They couldn’t take an ambiguous piece of work and deliver it. You had to really hold their hands to get them to deliver code. And it wasn’t even because they didn’t know what they we were doing, they did. It’s because they were so focused on proving themselves as sr, they fought against every single plan and needed to fight every little suggestion. They wouldn’t take any feedback, seeing feedback as a ding against their capabilities. They’d write “clever code” that was hard to read and often had edge case bugs, and if you mentioned it during a PR, then they’d just complain to the manager that I’m holding up the review. They’d publicly call out their manager when there was a decision that was made that they disagreed with. These behaviours are what held this person back, and it’s the same kind of behaviour that I’ve seen over and over again. Often times, just focusing on what’s on your plate and delivering outstanding work there is all you need to do. And then you have a convo with your manager and say “I’ve been building great stuff here, and I want to make it to the next level, give me more work please.” Promos are often not done by just your manager, they are done by a committee. You need a manager who is both respected and willing to back you for promo, and other managers who know your name and not willing to fight against your manager to their people.

But all the jobs I'm getting are in series-B startups, and they are completely incompatible with being a parent to a child with high needs. I actually tried, but things are just so unstable now. I got fired from a job after about 10 months despite busting my ass on it, and then the next job I found, I got laid off in about 8 months.Tech careers are so all-consuming, and if you want to run a family while in one, it means you're spending a ton of money on daycare, babysitters, after-school programs, summer camps, cleaning, and meal services. You can't turn on and turn off these things at will. Like I get my kid into a pretty expensive daycare that's taking 30% of my take-home, and then I get laid off... I can't just pull her from the daycare because I currently don't have an income, and then put her back in when my income stabilises. I have significant savings, but this type of uncertainty and demands means I can't actually build enough savings while I work, and my savings get depleted fast when I'm between jobs. And I'm not actually able to be a good parent if I'm constantly worried about getting fired or laid off.And AI is cool, but it feels like I'm expected to be up to date on using AI in my job, and I have to spend time outside of work to explore AI and stuff. Which I really don't have the time for. So I'm going back to school to get a teaching credential. There's a huge shortage of math and science teachers. I need something stable that offers benefits, so I'm not constantly worried about the high cost of COBRA coverage when I'm between jobs. The biggest benefit is, even if the job isn't flexible, I'm just DONE at 5pm. Even if I have to grade papers at home, it's not as cognitively demanding as being on-call at 2am when the server goes down. There are a lot of bad things said about teaching as a profession, and I personally know lots of teachers who got sick of it and quit, just as I got sick of tech and quit. But at this point in my life, it feels like a better career choice. I still love programming, and in my spare time, I am constantly coding apps, helping friends with their startups, and consulting.

I thought you had GraphQL listed twice at first, and my first boomer instinct was “if this person can’t proofread their own resume, why would I bother interviewing them if they care so little?” You are dealing with people with short fuses when people are reviewing your resume. Organize/categorize it better, so someone can digest the info more easily. It’s similar to the snark on Reddit when people joke about paragraphs. - “Contributed” sounds extremely passive. It sounds like your team built a feature while you were working on something else. Work on that section to show more involvement. Even something like “Developed a highly scalable…” might work better.

Are you someone who needs to move fast without bureaucracy?- What LOB (if told) would you join? The cost centers at Capital One face more attrition than profit centers (like Card Tech). The PIPs fly faster in other LOBs.- Are you okay with mediocrity? Not sure about your offer, but some teams don’t do flashy work. The tech stacks are bloated and poorly written by contractors. Some may have modern stacks.- How long do you see yourself working there? The WLB is fairly good, but the performance culture grinds years off your life for a mediocre pay and no RDU.&nbsp;I’ll also note, SA while a shit pay, will offer more shelter from PIPs than for PAs.

o3kg5cc,"Former C1 employee here. It’s the sketchiest company I’ve ever worked for. Left after I fulfilled my time requirement to not pay back the signing bonus & Relocation package. C1 tries to operate as if they’re AWS, the problem is that they’re not paying AWS money. They like to intentionally over-hire & rely on pip culture to incentivize employees to overwork themselves to be ranked appropriately. That leads me to my next thing, they do stack ranking for employees. This means that you’ll be ranked against employees at the same level as you & normally that would be fine, but a lot of orgs have company lifers. These people have been there their entire career or the majority of their career & they know the company inside & out so they’ll consistently set an incredibly high bar that new external hires have to adhere to within a few months of working at the company. With a company so reliant on internal systems that are poorly documented & long drawn-out (again, poorly documented) processes it’s hard to learn all of that while also navigating all the levels of bureaucracy & compliance that comes with fintech. Quite frankly unless you grossly overwork yourself on a regular basis for a year or two or you’re just an incredibly talented engineer it’s unlikely you’ll succeed there. Here are some additional things that you may find useful to know:- They reorg frequently, I’m talking every 6 months at least. So you’ll constantly be shifting teams or lose team members- Everything there is reliant on tons of internal tools & many basic things you’ll have to do will take significantly longer than expected because you have to ask many people who to contact about something then you have to fill out a form & then message someone to tell them you filled out the form then fill out the form again because you forgot to check a certain field on the form- The way the company operates with pip culture breeds a lot of toxic behavior between employees so you’ll encounter a lot of terrible behavior throughout your interactions. Plenty of good people there, but the amount of bad interactions you’ll encounter is relatively high.- as a woman you might find it relevant to know that there’s not many women working there in the engineering departments. I was there for a little over a year & I found out about 3 different serious scandals there involving harassment & encountered a lot of higher ups who are not very respectful towards women. All that being said, they do pay pretty decent, but in my opinion they do not pay nearly enough for how much it sucks to work there.

A day later, tell your recruiter you have some concerns you want to clarify. They’ll likely ask if you want to meet with the hiring manager or anyone else to discuss them.

The obvious fact of the matter is that social skills are not something that is intrinsic to CS people; social skills are required for the vast majority of jobs and are a life skill which most people have to some extent. It may be true that in a lot of lower paying jobs with not too much technical need, having social skills can put you ahead of others since that is the main differentiating factor; and there a lot of CS jobs like this, but then there also are a lot of CS jobs which are not like this and which demand IQ, technical knowledge and sophisticated problem solving abilities. These are the skills that not everyone has and not everyone has the ability to obtain. It is the reason why this field still pays so handsomely at the upper echelon despite the fact that it is oversaturated. The people with the above average programming skills are making bank because they are the real deal and it is not easy to replace them with others.I think most of the other answers given here more so correspond to more ""normal"" CS jobs that are comparable to most other white-collar work, as this is perhaps the default that comes to mind.

The engineering is up to us, not a bunch of corporate stooges and their worthless ""AI up-skilling"" powerpoints. I’ll give you a basic run down of everything important I've learned in the last year:1. Write an AGENTS.md file that gives a broad view of your repository with high level details like tech stack, folder structure, etc. Also point to which docs should be referenced if the agent needs to expand further for more details. This prompt will be injected in every conversation so keep the information broad/horizontal instead of deep/vertical.2. Learn how to sandbox your agent so you can run the agent in yolo mode and afk it. The 3 most popular options are: Claude code’s builtin sandbox mode, vscode’s dev containers, and docker’s new sandbox mode for running agents.3. Learn git worktrees so you can have agents work in the background without disrupting your normal workflow or if you want to parallelize work. (I recommend not trying to parallelize too much, most work is inter-dependent and it's usually easier to just work sequentially)4. Utilize skills and have a directory full of detailed instructions for each common task you do. For example, a frontend task that goes deep into detail on how you want your frontend code to be written. Unlike the AGENTS.md file, you want these docs to be deep and detailed. The agent will use progressive disclosure and only invoke those skills when its relevant so your context isn’t overloaded5. Learn about the ralph wiggum technique. This is essentially breaking extremely long tasks into subtasks and running the agent in a loop so that it can work on atomic tasks with a fresh context each time instead of trying to one-shot it and getting its context window trashed. This will involve: - A PRD doc explaining the feature and requirements in depth. - A tasks.json file with subtasks and acceptance criteria for each task. - A notes.md file so that it can jot down any information that might be relevant in between tasks. - And finally, a bash script to run your agent continuously. - There’s some good info [here](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents) along with more stuff if you google ralph wiggum.6. Standard engineering practices apply. Tons of high quality tests, linters, formatters, and strict type checkers.7. Set up a way for your agent to test changes. Whether thats setting up staging environments for backend work or setting up browser automation for frontend.8. Avoid MCPs like the plague. 99.99% of them are useless and will clog your context with useless tool definitions that the agent isn’t even good at invoking. The only mcp I recommend is this for browser automation: https://github.com/remorses/playwriter (NOT THE OFFICIAL PLAYWRIGHT MCP. The official one is trash and not optimized to preserve your context window)9. Learn your agent’s plugin system and write scripts to automate tasks that should be run deterministically.

This is because trash schools do not prepare you to pass the interview. You are better off doing community college for first 2 years to get the required classes out of the way for cheap. Then you take a few basic computer science classes. Then in state tuition nearby for the last 2 years.Real computer science is hard and time consuming. If you can't handle that, you won't pass the interviews. WGU or any of the for profit trash does NOT prepare you to go to work or to PASS THE INTERVIEW.So basically there are 3 tiers of schoolsIvy league or equivalent. These will get you interviews you may not get else where. You have to pass the interview.All other not for profit colleges have similar material. Most of these will prepare you to pass the interviews.For profit trash that is useless diploma mill crap and you will fail the interviews.Bottom line: Do ivy league or do instate tuition. Id also argue that any other private college is a waste of money because its much more debt and won't prepare you for the interview. Id also argue that community college for first 2 years to save money is a good idea too. Most of the computer science classes will be at the regular college.

o3rchns,"Okay so first I'll answer the general question, but then explain why this is less relevant for your specific case- Ivy League/high-prestige engineering schools- Specialty engineering schools (co-op programs, niche in-demand fields, etc)- the majority of schools (4-year mostly in person schools)- 100% online, shorter time period tracks, community college (for some employers)- non-accredited, non-standard degrees (e.g. I knew a private school that only did liberal arts degrees with ""focuses"") The perception of online schools is that they dont train you well for a work environment and they're easier to pass. This is about the same view as bootcamp-only people--its better than nothing, but it's just taken as nowhere near the same as the above.THAT SAID, for your specific case of already having a different degree **and teaching the subject**, I think WGU is a pretty good option. You already clearly have the interpersonal and project management skills needed to be functional in a workplace, and youre even more aligned since you have actually been doing some amount of programming already.I think you'll still struggle to get those first few jobs just because the career track is so railroaded towards the typical ""new grad with internships climbing up the ladder,"" but you absolutely can do it. I STRONGLY recommend freelancing to get your foot in the door, since it'll mean not needing to drop off of your teaching job. Tbh, if you can convince someone to let you build them a plugin for their website or make some open-source contributions, I think you could even end up with a ""typical eng job"" without a degree (though I don't recommend this).Anyways, my advice to you is1. Get the WGU degree2. While getting the degree, really really seek out a project or two from peers nearby. Maybe the school website could use some updating. Maybe your buddy wants clients to be able to schedule an appointment online rather than call him. These jobs will replace the typical ""internship"" experience companies want.3. Afterwards, seek out workplaces that can leverage your background. There is a TON of education tech being made by folk who have no idea what educators need.4. Be resilient. You're entering into a tumultuous field later than your competitors. There are going to be instances and people that make you feel small.

And if there's little to no documentation on what you think is important knowledge, document it and share it to the team (this shows you are 'team multiplier' and will look good to your performance review).

Don't schedule and just be like ""I don't know"". People don't like that. People like you put in SOME effort to try so show you put in the effort to try to make sense and are confused/lost. And screenshot every single step your teammate is doing so you don't forget or lose (so you can help organize later). Also, DM your teammates with help you need (do it to different team members a time so you don't overload one teammate). And make sure that DM (Slack setting or whatever is set to never delete). And again, screenshot/save any command, etc that comes out of it.Type more shit about your status and what you are doing in your team channel more. Last thing you want is to look invisible. Invisible == Looks like you aren't doing anything.I abuse the heck out of screenshotting in this field. Everything in every meeting when I see a screen is screenshot. I don't care how trivial. From the URL to what not I just screenshot.If this is in office, bribe your team members (and other close by office workers (from where you sit)) with occasional cookies/snacks or whatever.

For example, you won’t have any experience creating a product for real users. I do think most of these places offer some of the best jobs you can find that balance pay and work/life.

o49jhzu,"tl;dr; keep looking, this is at best a lateral move if not a step down.Context: I have \~20 YOE and currently am/have been in a senior US technology leadership role at small/medium-sized companies (40+ FTE reports in my area). I oversee software engineering, IT, DevOps, cybersec, and technical support/solutions teams which sounds very similar to what you're describing.>I’m a backend software engineer with about 2.5 years of experience>I’m currently at a service-based company and was promoted fairly early into a senior/lead-type roleFor starters, you are not market-competitive as a ""senior engineer"". Lots of differences in how titles are interpreted, but you are unlikely to place into a senior engineer position at a company with good engineering talent; you just haven't seen enough / could be trusted with important problems. I would be aiming for a mid-level position if I were you. I bet you *are* the most technical, talented person in your org, but this sounds like a ""big fish in a small pond"" situation; you will realize how impressive the talent out there is once you leave this pond.>I don’t feel great about where I am. The work is very project-driven, there isn’t much real product thinking, and there’s no meaningful senior mentorship above me. I’ve learned a lot by being pushed into responsibility early, but it also feels like I’m starting to plateau, and I’m not convinced staying longer actually improves my long-term trajectory.Good instincts; this is my read as well. You need to move on from this company or you *will* plateau.>The role is titled “Support Engineer,” which is what’s making me hesitate. On paper, it feels like a step down from a senior software engineering role. It sits between support and product engineering and involves debugging real production issues, understanding customer workflows, joining customer calls when needed, and applying code or database fixes.This sounds identical to what my org calls ""Solutions"". A typical solutions specialist/engineer has a CS degree from a small school or comes from a nontraditional background (bootcamp, self-taught, etc.). Required to code and know SQL, but isn't trusted to build customer-facing products from scratch. Much of their work is being responsive to customer demands; support tickets, onboarding new customers, code changes that are often formulaic / pattern repetition, etc.>They’ve described it as a way to build deep product and business context first, and then move engineers into product engineering teams once they’ve ramped up. I’ve also seen examples of people there who’ve followed that path....and this is exactly how I sell folks on doing the work, and getting paid less for it. I pitch the variety of tasks they have, how much they can learn technically and about our products. It's not *wrong* but it's also not saying the quiet part out loud: you aren't trusted to be a *full* software engineer, nor do we want to pay for that for this position.Have people successfully transferred to a full Software Engineer position from our Solutions org? Absolutely, and I love enabling that move. But due to classic company issues, it's very hard to pay them the same as their peers vs. an external direct hire.>What I’m stuck on is whether this is a reasonable tradeoff early in a career, or whether I’m taking on unnecessary risk by stepping into a role with “support” in the title and making it harder to move back into core engineering later. My longer-term goal is to work on real products, not remain in a service or ticket-driven environment. EDIT: The expected progression into SWE role is between 6-12 months based on performance and knowledge of the product.IMO if you're good at what you do, bet on yourself. Don't rely on a ""down the road"" transfer/promotion. Find a company that thinks you're good *now* and is willing to give you that responsibility and compensation. Even if they think you're ready in 6-12 months they might still delay on a move because you've proven yourself invaluable to their ""support"" organization and they don't have a backfill ready.>There’s also a timing element. My current role feels increasingly unstable, and I don’t have a lot of confidence in what comes after my current project. So while I could keep searching for a more traditional software engineering role, waiting several more months to optimize for a perfect outcome isn’t a totally neutral option either.I would ask them to go directly into a SE role instead of the support role, or else walk and keep looking.>Would you take this kind of role as a way to break into a US-led product environment, or keep searching?Caveat to all of the above: if you are not in the US and you live in a country where employment opportunities are scarce, you might need to toss all of my advice and take the job anyway. For example, if you live in Pakistan and are having trouble finding *any* job that is technical and pays reasonably well, this might be your best angle to transition into something better. I can't speak to your personal job market situation; my advice is based around what I know best (US labor market and you have authorization to work).",Adder00,2026-02-08 15:26:45,4,cscareerquestions,t3_1qz768l,False,

o4b8s3u,"I took a similar career trajectory and don't regret it. Started at company A as an SWE and stayed there for 5 years. As it was my first job out of college, it didn't pay well but it gave me a lot of good experience. I then nearly doubled my salary by accepting a role at company B doing the kind of debug-level support you describe, and since I had significant software engineering knowledge from my first job, I excelled and was promoted to a lead and received numerous raises.
