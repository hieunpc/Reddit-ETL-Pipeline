nqvym96,"This is a broad question so I will give you an broad answer.I prefer a minimal orch layer and split the data pulling from transformation layer unless you require a very complex normalisation and cleaning. So it depends. How complex the data is and how forward you go towards the insights/analytics layer? If the data is not complex and you insights to be extracted, delegate this to a modelling tool like dbt and use your pipelines to pull data only and trigger dbt to keep it simple. If data is complex requiring many normalisations or multiple sources that a simple sql cannot do, threat your pipelines like a library to process data in its context. But remember early optimisation is the evil. So its not a question of preference, is what you have to do at THIS time to keep it simple, readable and maintainable for your future self without over engineering. This rule is only yours (or maybe also for your team). Sometimes it is ok to over-bloat one or two flows because you will touch that once in a year and nobody else will or if it fails nobody will get hurt. I personally consider this and also I don't mind to have duplicated code 3x into 3 flows, so the 4th one will justify a refactor.

nraiegn,"Not a consultant but I've just been brought into a medium sized org and have been working on a Fabric PoC. Mixed experiences. The bad:- There is at times a large desync when reading and writing to lakehouses and warehouses. PySpark operation will complete and show transformations applied within a session only for the data to not match at the endpoint for... A while. No hard numbers on this but seen others talking about it. Bottlenecks development and is really frustrating. - The low code solutions are terribly inefficient. My first time testing a basic Dataflow Gen2 operation ran for way too long and had a ridiculously large CU consumption, so if you want to handle ETL processes better get dug into Spark notebooks (I've been using PySpark which is considerably faster and more performant than the Dataflow seemed, not sure how other Spark modules behave) - Speaking of CU consumption, interrogation of compute is so... Opaque. Want to see how much CU your new code block uses? You're out of luck if you've ran it multiple times for debugging and testing - there's no way to get a granular report on costing. The documentation here isn't much better. - Managing a traditional Dev -> Prod pipeline feels harder than necessary. Currently I'm running a NonProd/Prod architecture where end users only have access to a workspace with models loaded into a warehouse because as far as I can tell there is no object level security available within a workspace. There's also no way that I've found to directly write across workspaces, so I'm shortcutting my endpoint data in the NonProd workspace to a lakehouse is the Prod workspace, then using cross warehouse T-SQL to create views for the end users.The good:- For an organisation with a large investment in PowerBI with multiple workspaces and satellite teams within the business, I can see how Fabric might be a good solution that slots in nicely. In it's current state I'm not sure that it pulls ahead of any other architecture solutions. - It's an interesting playground for less technical users to 'get their hands dirty'; I see the appeal. As mentioned before however, I discounted the low code options pretty quickly so it remains to be seen how this will progress. - There is native CoPilot integration in Fabric (when set up with the right licence option in workspaces). I haven't tested this out yet but I imagine this will be useful for people in the business to ask questions and interrogate data without requiring models to be built or a knowledge of SQL or PowerBI development. Overall it's not terrible and if you're already paying for a fabric capacity you're not incurring additional costs if your capacity has headroom. For users with a less technical background I'm not sure if the juice would be worth the squeeze as every end user I've spoken to has gravitated to Dataflows for ETL work as it's familiar to them (it works like an online PowerQuery interface).

The way I think about it is the DB serves as your UI and this simplifies worrying about security and misuse. Not to say these concerns don’t exist, but I don’t feel like they’re as complex to resolve. The real complexity/stress comes in taking disparate data from various systems in various formats, that’s available in disjunct timeframes and making it fit into a cohesive/canonical model that represents how the business/analysts thinks about operations.

Deadlines are everywhere. Hard-to-diagnose problems are probably everywhere, too, especially when you inherit things. Sometimes specific tools are worse for it (I've heard comments in this regard about Spark, for example).I've done this transition, albeit kind of unconsciously. It's been good. Having software background is definitely valuable, I think. It probably depends some on your stack, but I also think there is *a lot* of crossover. Especially if you consider that often it's the soft-skills that count, too.I started in general development, primarily working on an internal web-based system using .NET Core. That job started having more and more ""reporting"" work, using the same backend database, but SSRS was the frontend instead. From there, into an analyst type role, which rapidly became a catch-all ETL-developer-report-builder-platform-admin role. Last few years it has become more about ""engineering"", admin, and architecture. I'm very much enjoying it. Early on, I did miss working in code that wasn't primarily SQL (and especially wasn't DAX), and the ways in which we did it - like devops processes and dev tools. I've seen that shift where I am now, partly because team, partly because tool set with us jumping into Databricks. The inner software dev has much more cause to come back to the surface. I've been in a position to bring devops practices in. I'm thinking again about things like encapsulation and DRY. I was not the whizz-bang top-dog developer, but I picked up some good fundamentals and experience. It's helpful as a data-focused engineer. Is DE a good fit for you?

In a scenario if prompt injection happens or there is a case where the policy gets bypassed, the attacker would only get access to details in the isolated view and have no way of accessing the entire database.

Ship a dbt template with tests, a Dagster/Prefect scaffold, and Terraform modules that create Snowflake roles/warehouses, storage, tags, and budgets by default. Define data contracts and schema versioning; require an RFC for breaking changes. Bake in observability: OpenLineage/Marquez, Great Expectations, freshness and cost SLOs to Slack. Standardize access with RBAC, masking, and secrets rotation; document the request flow and SLAs. Timebox thin slices ahead of demand (one CDC source, one model, one serving pattern) and track adoption, cost per query, and incident rate. Treat the platform like a product: backlog, office hours, and clear deprecations.We used AWS API Gateway and PostgREST, and DreamFactory to auto-generate REST APIs from Snowflake/SQL Server so app teams shipped without custom services.Bottom line: build products and policies that make the happy path easy and the risky path rare.",Adventurous-Date9971,2025-12-01 10:52:32,6,dataengineering,t1_nrn7bp9,False,

nrd1k1i,"I'm still new to DE but I'm going try to answer so that if there are wrong parts, I hope they will be corrected by experts. 1. normalized / denormalized processes are transformations, so making decision of adding / removing transformations to / from the process comes first from the business logic but may also be organizational decision from the data architecture stage or constrained by compliance. E.g: denormalized data are normalized to store quality data (center of star), then denormalized (dimensions) for reporting for example. 2. Generally, it's a combination of the data management stage where we decide sources to use (maybe reliable ones) and define ""rules"", and the data architecture stage where we structure data. For examples, from three sources S1, S2, and S3, maybe we keep only S1 and S3 because data from S2 are not reliable (bad quality). Then data shapes and values from S1 and S3 which may differ at multiple points but generally unique identifier is used (like email), here is where ""rules"" are applied, for example use the email as identifier, set data with no value to NULL, if two other addresses have different values, keep the one which match the phone number, ... 3. An example is where instead of creating dimensions which is a transformation, we directly serve the data, and then flexible queries will retrieve them on demand. I hope it helps :)",dontereddit,2025-11-29 10:45:51,1,dataengineering,t3_1p9deke,False,
nrldju1,"1. Even if data is already denormalized at the source, it may or may not fit the analytical use case. Denormalized only means attributes are combined, not that the structure matches the grain or logic needed for reporting. If the current shape works, you can keep it. If it doesn’t, you transform it into whatever structure performs well-normalize first, remodel into facts/dims, or rebuild a wider table. The model itself isn’t the goal; usability and query performance are. So denormalized is different with ready for analytics. Adjust the structure when needed to make it clean, fast, and reliable.2. Multiple customer sources with different IDs and attributes usually lead to a conformed customer dimension. The goal is to unify identity across systems using a surrogate key, then merge records via deterministic or fuzzy matching rules. You track history using SCD when attributes change over time. From the conformed dimension, you can also generate shrunken dimensions when a specific process only needs a subset of attributes - reducing complexity and improving performance while keeping consistency. The key idea is: one enterprise-wide definition of customer, multiple shapes depending on analytical needs. For more details, you can read the chapter ""Integrate via conformed dimension"" of The Data Warehouse Toolkit.3. A star schema is part of dimensional modeling and works great for data warehousing because it’s simple, performant, and easy for business users to query. But it isn’t the only modeling approach. Data Vault focuses on flexibility and historical tracking when dealing with many changing data sources, while the Inmon approach builds a 3NF enterprise warehouse before data marts, or One Big Table stores data in wide-tables,... Each method has strengths and trade-offs, so the right choice depends on requirements - speed to deliver, data complexity, volume, regulatory needs.",chimeyrock,2025-11-30 20:18:43,1,dataengineering,t3_1p9deke,False,
nrqk404,"Model to answer the questions your team actually asks: conform once, then denormalize for how you query, with a real customer identity strategy.1) If a source arrives denormalized, land it as-is, then build conformed dims/facts from it; marts can re-flatten for BI. Reuse the same cleaned staging models so you’re not doing the work twice. Materialize dims/facts as tables and use incremental loads where it helps.2) For customer, create a surrogate-keyed dimcustomer and a customerxref (sourcesystem, sourceid, customersk, matchconfidence, matched\_on, rule). Do deterministic matches first (tax ID, email+dob), then fuzzy for names/addresses. Store survivorship rules for attributes, run SCD2, and route low-confidence cases to a review queue so ops can merge/split and you can replay history. I’ve used Fivetran for ingestion and dbt for modeling, Great Expectations for tests, and DreamFactory to expose a lightweight approval API for those manual merges without giving warehouse write access.3) Skip strict star when you need event streams with nested arrays, high-card time series, graphy relationships, or an ODS/Data Vault layer feeding multiple marts.Main point: keep raw raw, standardize once into conformed models, denormalize only where it serves the queries, and treat customer identity as a first-class process :)",gardenia856,2025-12-01 17:04:36,1,dataengineering,t3_1p9deke,False,

If so, you may find it more useful to create a set of compound keys (which could also be expressed in a singular column as a hashkey, which is my preference) - which contain all identifier columns that make each record unique. Then there's a question of data consistency - are we dealing with slowly changing dimensions or static facts? You don't want to create a key with nulls in it, but equally so you don't want to establish a new record each time a customer updates their info. So much of these considerations are determined by both the business logic at the point of collection (data source) and the desired update pattern for your tables.Getting this all diagrammed out alongside mapping out the business rules ahead of the engineering process will make everyone's work much easier, as at that point it's mostly plug-and-play to build your DDL and DML pieces.As much as I personally bristled at Medallion architecture when I was first introduced to it, I realized you can think of your raw sources as the bronze layer, the normalized star schema as the silver layer, and all downstream transformations as your gold layer. Alternatively, you can stick with the classic approach of a raw dataset, staging tables, production tables, and data marts for specific user groups if your governance plan allows for it/business needs require it. You can also mix and match with materialized views substituting for tables if they fit your needs and your platform supports them.This doesn't work for all types of data or use cases, but hopefully gives you something to work with and learn from.",Master-Ad-5153,2025-11-29 16:33:12,1,dataengineering,t1_nrd1k1i,False,

This means you can run Python anywhere, and not limited by what Snowpark or similar platforms allow you to do with dbt Python models. * Bruin uses `uv` in the background, meaning that your pipelines will work even if you don't have Python installed, and each task runs separately in isolated environments.* Native column-level lineage in open-source and open-source [VSCode/Cursor extension](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/vscode-extension/overview.html).* Bruin allows [defining policies](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/getting-started/policies.html) in code to apply your SQL statements, e.g. ""this SQL model must have an owner"" or ""it must follow these rules"". You can enforce these in your ci/cd pipelines.* `bruin validate` validates all your queries via dry-run to check if they are valid, this means invalid code never lands. * Bruin contains embedded sqlfluff for linting with your existing rules.* Bruin has an open-source MCP server to let agents build/help with your T layer.* dbt has \`doc\` macro, Bruin contains a built-in [glossary](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/getting-started/glossary.html) instead.Both tools are useful in their own ways, and share different approaches, hope this comparison is helpful.",karakanb,2025-11-28 17:55:28,2,dataengineering,t1_nr8xjvb,False,

Yep, this is the case for every table and also this one, we can identify the PK and normally store the hash as well with it in a new column as we use it to build our data vault/silver layer on it. In case a PK exists, we compare the hash of the concat of all columns except the PK.2. For this specific table we would do a initial load from 2015 to today if we would build the table now and then starting from tomorrow we would load a full year back every day. When loading, we would then compare only records going one year back as otherwise the query would close all records between 2015 and the 28th of November 2024. 3. Yeah, considering Iceberg here! Played with it and the ""timestamp"" function really makes it way easier to go back then playing with the valid from/ valid to date columns. The only thing i can't get my head around is. When we would use snapshots instead of SCD2, then i assume it would be something like:\- Initial load - All rows ranging from 2015 - today with snapshot date today (\~12 mln rows)\- Every day after today - All rows for the last 365 days - snapshot date of that specific date (\~1 mln rows)It adds 365 mln. rows in a year and when i want to know the last version of a PK on a specific date i would need to partition by and order by the PK to get the latest version. Thereby, if a record gets deleted in the source system there's no way to mark it in my append only db without making a SCD2 kind of script that fills in a valid\_to or is\_deleted flag. i'm probably wrong but the snapshot system seems to be best fit in cases you know your source system will never delete anything.",Crazy-Sir5935,2025-11-28 11:05:04,1,dataengineering,t1_nr4o5zk,True,

(2) switch to incremental/CDC for ongoing sync. Fabric has a CDC/Copy job feature and you can also use Delta Change Data Feed in Lakehouse tables to capture row-level changes for reliable upserts. (3) automate discovery of new tables by keeping a metadata table or using the Fabric REST/metadata APIs in a pipeline to list Lakehouse tables and loop over them to create/update copy jobs. Community threads show people scripting this when they need to scale. About schema drift: Fabric’s copy tools can do mapping but they are not perfect at automatically absorbing arbitrary schema changes for all workloads. If you expect frequent schema churn, consider an ELT pattern: keep canonical data in the Lakehouse and run periodic MERGE queries from Lakehouse into Warehouse tables (or materialized views) using the Delta CDF or SQL MERGE so you have deterministic upserts. If you want a starting checklist: pick Copy job for initial load, enable incremental or CDC for high-change tables, build a pipeline that enumerates tables and triggers jobs for new ones, and use Delta CDF or MERGE for schema-safe upserts.

Classic compute doesn’t maintain that persistent MV state or the orchestration hooks, so Databricks can’t safely do partial updates there.If OP wants incremental: create the MV on a serverless SQL warehouse or Lakeflow serverless; keep base tables in Delta with change data feed enabled; avoid unsupported bits like non-deterministic UDFs, ORDER BY, or some complex windows.

In a DG application like Collibra which I've used, you map the physical fields (say field ""customer\_id"") to a Data Element, and that element can be Customer ID.A business term (used in a business glossary) should be agnostic to what is physically in the back-end. That is a logical concept, and a business glossary helps promote common language among business users. But I find it generally redundant if you already have a data dictionary which should provide a robust definition of what is physically in the field. But there are cases when business terms/business glossary can be useful. For example a CUSIP is a security identifier with its own logical definition, but the physical field ""cusip\_id"" could have dummy identifiers in it, which would necessitate differentiating between the logical (CUSIP) and the physical (cusip\_id).",mdecav,2025-11-28 17:39:27,1,dataengineering,t1_nr6npyx,True,

Otherwise, it might instead be a clue that the system is now being used in a novel way, and you (or your downstream data consumers) might need to react to that. Not DQ, just an evolution of how you need to interpret the data. E.g. Maybe the developers of the source application are now ""overloading"" the orders table, using it intentionally to store some entity that isn't strictly an order, but has very similar columns - except there's no such thing as a user for this new concept. There's probably a type_id or similar in this case, that has a new value distinguishing this novel use case from the old use case. All this is just one example explanation, of many; the wider point is, there could be a good reason why the userid column is null. Rather than going to the data owner trying to raise it as an assumed problem, you might get a quicker answer if you assume the best and just ask ""can someone tell me what it means when there's a null userid?"".

nrrlwee,"Sorry, this will be a bit long, but I think it might help.Quick disclaimer: I’m one of the founders of Bruin, an asset based data platform similar to dbt and Dagster, so I’m obviously biased. But I’ll try to keep this rooted in how things actually work in the industry.The difference you’re seeing between infra-heavy Zoomcamp projects and more “software-engineered” Python repos isn’t a real contradiction. They represent different layers of the stack. Zoomcamp is trying to give you a broad picture of what you *might* see in a real team. Not every company uses Terraform or Docker, but many do, so the course touches those pieces early. Later, the focus shifts more toward dbt/Bruin-style asset based work, which is how a lot of modern data pipelines are actually built and maintained.In practice, most companies mix both approaches. The orchestrator (Airflow, Dagster, Bruin, etc.) handles scheduling and execution. The actual transformation logic usually lives in asset definitions: SQL models or small Python transforms with clear dependencies. When that logic becomes more complex or gets reused, teams extract it into a proper Python package with a src/ layout, tests and versioning. So the “tool based” approach and the “modular Python project” approach are not alternatives; they stack on top of each other.The industry is moving toward asset based workflows because they offer a clearer dependency graph, builtin testing, ownership, lineage and easier debugging. That’s why tools like dbt, Dagster and Bruin are becoming common.For someone applying to an internship, the goal is not to master every tool. It’s enough to show that you can write clean Python, understand Docker at a basic level, have touched one orchestrator, and can describe your work as a data flow. A simple infra-driven project plus a small, well-structured Python module is already strong.If you can show that mix, you’re in very good shape for junior roles.",PolicyDecent,2025-12-01 20:12:10,1,dataengineering,t3_1pbmo3x,False,

nrbnz04,"My background:I graduated with a master's in CS about a year ago. I'm still looking for work, but part of this was my own doing for not doing a technical internship while I was in school and not doing more personal projects (I want to teach as a 2nd career, so I tutored/did teaching jobs for CS during my summers. At the time tech was still stable, so I did not think I had to do a technical internship. You live, make choices, and you learn). I'd think about first why you hate CS and why you have negative feelings about it. For people I've tutored, usually their hatred for CS was resentment for not pursuing their passions, feelings of frustration for not understanding the material (often trying to do the work alone), math phobias, not connecting with the material, or a mixture of those reasons. All extremely valid reasons and reasons often reliant on your environment (bad profs, depression, lack of community, etc). Before you decide to jump ship from CS, be extremely honest with yourself. Did you give CS your full effort? This means if you had the time, did you attend Office hours, talk to your professors, try to talk to peers, go to tutoring (if you could afford/uni offered it), join CS clubs, etc? If the answer is no, then something was holding you back from giving it a full shot, so you need to figure out what that is and if it's within your control to get past it. Some people, even with the best tutors, need more time to learn STEM subjects than the 4 years expected out of uni- this is completely normal, but may not be a financial option for all students (which is an unfortunate position to be during later years of uni and will require some tough decisions).If you have managed to stay in your CS program this far without acidemic probation, then you likely understand *some* aspects of code, but too many knowledge gaps are there to make you see the big picture (which in CS is important, its when everything begins to click). With enough hustle, I think you can salvage the rest of your degree and make it through- but this will require complete humility to get there. You making this reddit post in full honesty about your knowledge gaps makes me think you might be able to do it. Next steps would be scheduling meetings with your profs, get a tutor if possible, talk to your GTAs, joining study groups, etc. The key part of wanting anyone to support you in your success is to take the initiative (with humility) and be consistent (show up, do the work). I've had students reach out to me with failing grades halfway through the course with humility, and it was that act of bravery that lead to them passing the class (if they put the work in).My best advice is to find a prof you like/trust in your CS department and have an honest convo with them. I'd also schedule an appointment with career services and talk to them too (you pay a ton of money to be in uni- use your resources!!!). Ask them if there is a realistic way for you to finish your degree with the knowledge gaps or if it's for the best you switch. I know plenty of people that made CS a minor and switched to business with a technical component- there could be options you aren't aware of, but you need to have those conversations with people who have that knowledge.Even if you do switch- get that internship! It's extremely important in this job market, and the easiest way to get and prove you have experience.Good Luck! Always happy to chat further. I have personally supported many CS students to find the acidemic path right for them (even if it meant a different major) and also helped many find the fun in CS to get through it (a lot actually went from hating to loving CS).

Tech is arguably one of the most community oriented STEM fields out there, especially evident in it's history. Lean into this strength!I guarentee you have at least 5 classmates who feel exactly like you. Next time you go to class, talk to a few classmates and ask them if they are doing any side projects, how they feel about leetcode, etc. Do not feel discouraged if you hear a few people talk about their side projects/ease with leetcode- find comfort in being aware of people more knowledgeable than you in your community- you can learn a lot from them! Once you got enough feelers, start figuring out what you want to do with that info. Is someone working on a side project that sounds interesting? Then see if you can do something similar or ask if there is any way you can join in on it. Are a lot of students struggling too? Then form a study group together and collectively figure out what projects you can work on either together (get that github practice in) or independently. Even if you are surrounded by many people who ""have it together"", ask them what got them there and how you can be more involved. Whatever you do with the feelers, make sure it's rooted in community and doing work consistently. Personal projects have really frustrating hurdles, so you need that support system to get you to keep going.Your professors are also goldmines of knowledge too, so ask them what types of personal projects you can work on or some general guidance- literally email them to schedule a meeting.If there is one thing college gives you, it's the opportunity to connect with people (your first network). One of the best lessons I took away from college is it only takes one person to get the momentum to build a community- so if you can't find community that will help you grow, then that is a sign you need to put in the work to build it. The other big lesson I learned in college is that people really admire someone who openly wears humility and accountability on their sleeve- it builds trust and leaves room for stronger connections to grow.Whenever I have feelings of imposter syndrome kicking in with thoughts like ""I could never achieve x"", I pause and ask myself ""But why not me?"". And I keep asking why until I have measurable steps I can take to improve.Hope that helps!

The real metric of general knowledge/skill is what projects you have made. Since you say you haven't made anything, the best time to start making a project is right now, whenever you have some free time to spare. Pick something you find interesting and just start making it. The hardest thing is looking at a blank editor, but once you write the first few lines (even if it's just a bunch of comments outlining the general program flow you are going to implement), you'll naturally fall into a pipe-line of problems you have to solve, allowing you to iteratively reach a solution over time. There's no shame in using google or any other forms of documentation, everyone does it, and if they don't then they're either lying or making something trivial. The only thing I'd avoid, or at least use with extreme caution, is any form of generative A.I. Ideally, you'd use it as a tool or a tutor, asking it to explain concepts or answer some questions you might have. However, in reality most people (especially beginners/learners!) fall into the trap of having the A.I. do everything for them, and essentially ""outsource"" their thinking to the machine. By that point, you may as well not waste your time, since you will learn nothing.You should also avoid falling into the trap of ""collecting"" languages as if they are Pokemon. You should be focusing on language-agnostic concepts, which can be implemented in a variety of languages (some of which will be better suited than others to whatever you're making). Of course, it's ideal to have a basic grasp of the language you are going to use, but if you're firm in your language-agnostic concepts, it will be easy to just pick up the syntax along the way.As an answer to your question, it's definitely not over.

So, this is not a useful phrase for detecting plagiarism. However, ""fourscore and seven years ago"" *is* improbable.

This utilizes libraries, wikipedia, internet resources, and other online databases that have content to check. Then take a person's work, and cross reference everything in your data base. It will essentially go through line by line, and then look for similarities to the library. I can only think of how to apply it to essays and papers, but it could be:1. Step 1: Start with similar words. The checker will take the piece you're working on, and compare similar words to others. If the piece you're working on reveals a high number of shared words, then it gets ""flagged"" for further examination. 2. Step 2: Take the piece you're comparing, and the other pieces of work that share some close similarities, and then reveal similar phrases/sentences. If the similar phrases ended up being long enough (multiple words/sentences), then the likelihood that it was plagiarized increases. (ie: a phrase ""too bad"" isn't going to flag it, but if someone quotes a full abstract from a scientific paper then it flags it as copied).3. Step 3: determine a way to program it to detect plagiarism vs referencing/quoting other works. You'd have to look up formatting options (like the usage of quotation marks, and other steps required to reference other notations). 4. Step 4: Iterate and reiterate the process until it becomes better, faster, or more robust. For code and math, especially on the lower scale like cs50, it's harder because a lot of the solutions for dedicated questions have 1 solution.

nqtm6sg,"Look at it from a different perspective:When you learn how to be a carpenter, do you go right to building a house to get better? No, you build a crappy chair. Then you keep building several until it looks a little less crappy. Then you build other objects and repeat the process. If you do that enough times, you'll naturally pick up other tools and methodologies that'll help you with your building. Over time, you'll be able to start building a house with your experience. You won't know what many tools are called, names of all the screws, and the best way to use everything. You just pick them up and try them out, learning as you build things..You're a **beginner** trying to build a house (Minecraft mods) when you don't even know what a hammer does (Java). Of course that'll feel overwhelming. First, play around with Java. Follow a tutorial or two about it. Maybe do a course or make something cool. There's no ""am I ready?"" You're ready whenever you say you're ready, whether that's after a 1hr yotube playlist or a several week MOOC. You'll *never* know everything about Java. Never. You can get a PhD in CS with Java and not know how to build a single project. Fortunately, you don't need to know *everything* about Java or CS to accomplish your goals. Don't let that lack of knowledge make you afraid to start building with it. You can start building things even after a simple 1hr tutorial. It would be a far cry from MC mods (little chair vs a hige house), but it's definitely enough to start your journey. I'd probably go through a beginner course utilizing Java. Udemy? Coursera? mooc.fi? Pick your poison. Anything works. [Pick one of the links at the beginning and get started](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjava/comments/1kla4xc/comment/ms0p7yn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).I'd probably go for the Udemy one. Hyperskill is more expensive, but it'll probably be the easiest intro to Java. The mooc is probably going to be very in-depth, and very hard, but free. Probably overkill. Coursera might have some free courses. There are many. Just choose whatever beginner Java course you can find. Whatever your choice is, just go through it until you know a little bit about Java. Your goal is simple exposure and to be able to build small little things that output into a terminal. They likely won't teach you how to build things in MC and you may be exposed to a lot of concepts you won't find immediately useful. Just get comfortable seeing code, using code, and thinking like a programmer.Don't go down a rabbit hole of things (remember the PhD comment?). Java can build practically anything, so you'd be able to learn so much without achieving your goals. Just get the basics down until you're comfortable. .Once you have a basic understanding of what Java is, go straight into learning how to mod.[Here's one resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1csh3yp/comment/l44waul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)[Here's another](https://www.mcjty.eu/docs/intro)There are a lot.Don't freak out. You won't know anything really. The above Java stuff was just getting you used to the hammer, nails, properties of wood, etc (depending on the resource, you may have built a chair or two).This, however, is the real deal. You're actually going to start building chairs, and it's going to suck and it will look like crap. You won't even know a lot of the things being talked about and you'll feel like you're at the very beginning again. That's okay and perfectly normal. You have to acquire a few more tools, but Java is the biggest learning curve and the one everything interacts with, so it's the one I recommended getting comfortable with first. Go through tutorial after tutorial about Minecraft mods, follow the beginner steps, and try to recreate things as they do it. Then try to do it again without the video, pausing each time. Then try to manipulate what you've created, or even break it. Then try to repeat the entire process from scratch until you recreate it (minus the setting up your tools part).Then move on to the next tutorial. Once you've acquired enough small skills, try to go about building a simple little thing yourself (you can even try after your first tutorial). This simple thing might be insanely hard. You might have to reference different documentation and videos to help you out. Once you finally finish it, try to improve it. Try to recreate it if you really want to reinforce the knowledge. Then move onto the next idea. Once you do that enough, you should be able to see other people's source code for their projects and be able to pick out little bits and pieces that you might want to try yourself, or research about to see what it does. Try to contribute to an open source mod or pull from their projects and play around with the code. That series of building is what will eventually get you to creating your own big ideas. People legit go through the Kaupenjoe videos (first link) without even knowing *any Java* and successfully learn how to build projects after a year. You can start that way too, but I thought maybe it'd feel better knowing a little bit about Java first (if you already don't know anything). If you're overwhelmed, skip everything I told you and go straight to that. It'll be very hard and scary, but learning to program is a marathon, not a single sprint..I can't really help you beyond that. Things take time. Don't stress about memorizing everything, being perfect in everything you do, or finding the best paths. Just progress, 1hr a day, every single day. .A painter doesn't get good after their first stick figure. They do tens of thousands of failed small attempts that build up to the occasionally solid large attempt. As they build up their skills from a ton of small, crappy projects, the eventually move onto more and more quality on each piece. Their skills don't manifest from perfecting their pain brush, getting the best pigments they can, or knowing absolutely everything they can about color theory. Don't worry about getting the best tutorial, learning Java perfectly, and being overwhelmed by all these new ideas. Just go through the first thing you see related to MC mods, that makes sense to you, and work up your skills, little by little.",Happiest-Soul,2025-11-26 03:38:21,6,learnprogramming,t3_1p63eza,False,

Programmers are just the people who stuck with it longer than others. Nothing special about them. A good way to retain what you learn is trying to apply it to your goal. Since you have one already that's excellent and a great motivator. Every time you learn something think of how you can apply it to that goal of making apps and modding Minecraft.

nrfk610,"There probably isn’t for a few reasons. When you look at something like mathematics, or really most subjects you take in school, you can see this level like structure where most things you learn earlier support nearly everything you learn later. Eventually you have to specialize and your field will have knowledge that is specific to it, and not applicable to other experts.I’ve found that with programming, it doesn’t really neatly fit into a nice sequence, because it’s far less sequential, and far more parallel. You learn *out* rather than you learn *up* if that makes any sense. And you advance in terms of your general maturity, rather than specific knowledge building on each other as theorems imply further theorems. The other thing is that programming sits in this place between academia and a trade, where there’s a ton of “craft” and professional knowledge that exists in the form of essentially folk wisdom transmitted via forums and blogs, not books. All that is to say, it’s harder to curate a list like you imagine, and there’s going to be way more disagreement about it when they do.Here is a list of articles about software which I think are all excellent, but decidedly mostly on the advanced side.

nrjkx3l,"First, there’s a certain amount of “don’t go crazy with conventions” in service development. You’re receiving formatted text that your host binds to a handing method which in turn returns formatted text. Taking the long view, Rest is simply a point of view that “the http verb in the formatted text header should dictate the operation” which replaced the previous opinion which more or less said “just use post or get for that mandatory verb header and name your operation in the relative path and the name should usually match the handling method so you can find things”. Neither is wrong. People just have strong opinions about formatted text. Bonus: If you really want to annoy people, go take the position that soap with xsd-defined payloads is more precise, more extensible, and can be more secure than rest with json (it is) and that devs were simply too lazy to learn the spec. It’s a bit better now that swagger (open api) is more mainstream, but for a while rest was a real pain to consume.The next thing to remember is that your reaction is valid and you’re often going to have more tailored controller services for web front ends. These aren’t enterprise APIs. They’re part of the same logical application and are only services because the halves run on two different computers. Otherwise they would just be helper or data layer methods. We do this because chattiness and sequential service call latency is the death of web pages. So if a commonly used page needs a getMyStuff composite method that returns a splittable json payload in one hit, that’s not crazy.

You use it to create an object which looks like the class. Then you call the methods on that object. The reason you would want to do this is because you have multiple objects which are essentially the same, or similar. For example, take the ghosts in Pac-Man. You could write this by declaring X and Y co-ordinate variables for each ghost, but then you'd have a bunch of variables like ghost1x and ghost3y and ghost4x and so on. Think about how writing collision detection would work. You'd have to check if ghost1x==playerx && ghost1y==playery || ghost2x==playerx && ghost2y==playery.... nightmare.Instead, define a ghost class, and instantiate it four times, once for each ghost.

The real way you learn OOP isn’t by studying diagrams, it’s by modeling small real systems, giving each class a clear responsibility, and avoiding the “giant class with 20 methods” trap. That shifts your thinking from: the procedural way: “What steps do I need to do?” to the OOP way: “What objects exist in this world, and what responsibilities do they have?”2. Tutorials don’t teach design, books do. If you want actual design and not just syntax, these beginner-friendly resources are gold: **""Head First Design Patterns""**: the best intro to OOP thinking, **""Practical Object-Oriented Design""**: very readable and extremely practical, and **""Refactoring improving design of existing code""**: not OOP-specific, but teaches you to *see* structure and smell bad design3. Another underrated tip: read good OOP code. Python libraries, open source github repositories, or even frameworks.4. On the language choice: Python can teach you OOP, but it’s a multi-paradigm language, so beginners often get mixed signals. If you want the concepts to crystallize faster, something more “pure OOP” like Java, C#, or Ruby tends to make the underlying principles way clearer.

nr50u7m,"Actually language can make a difference as does implementation. floats can be 32 bit or 64 bit compliant. Then there is the question of are they IEEE floats or something else. That being said I'm not sure if there are any FP units that do 64 bit faster than 32 bit.As for your programs, you should always ask why you need more precision. IEEE supports FP32, FP64 and FP128 as for what you are calling shorts I suspect that is language dependent and is not a floating point type. Often we are talking about ""floats"" as 32 bits and ""doubles"" as 64 bits (C++). There is also a potential for long doubles. Again in the context of C++, shorts are integer types, so shorts would almost always be faster than the floating point unit. The big but is that this can be execution unit dependent. I can't help with C# as i know zip about it, but if shorts are integers there then you might want to look into your understanding of the language. Integers and floats have two different use cases. it is important to understand that floats are approximations.So when you ask which is faster, you need to ask what hardware is it running on. GPU's can really muck things up because of special types and optimizations. One of those optimizations is what can be done in parallel. For example if the GPU (for example) 128 16 bit integer operations per cycle as opposed to say 32 doubles per cycle which is faster? What I'm trying to say here is that it depends on the specifics of language and hardware the code runs on. In the made up numbers above the processor would complete 4x more operations per cycle.Caches are a wholly different discussion. Generally shorter types means more data in cache but you also need to consider cache line length and other behaviors. If you have truly time critical code you may need to optimize for cache behavior on a specific processor. It is completely possible to arrange things (floating point operations) such that cache might not be a problem compared to integer.",spinwizard69,2025-11-28 00:24:34,3,learnprogramming,t3_1p8fwj1,False,
nr5kuv6,"on most cpu, there is a lot of conversion going on. The FPU converts all floating point type to a large type with excess bits to help reduce errors, so those floats get a double (pun?!) conversion from their 32 bit value to a 80 or 120 or whatever it is now bit value, the computations are done, and it gets converted back again to the smaller value. Integers don't suffer as much of this on some hardware, it just depends. X86 type chips for example has overlapped registers for 1, 2, 4, and 8 byte integers all in the same physical circuits, so it does not have to promote a 32 bit int to a 64 bit and back to do the computations. Also, integer circuitry \*in general\* is simpler than floating point, due to how it has to handle the exponent and base for floats while integers are pretty much simple math. I mean a multiply in binary is either a copy of the value (multiplied by 1) or all zeros (by zero) so a multiply is just steps that shift and add. A multiply in floating point is notably more complicated.I don't know the modern timings. FPUs are VERY fast. Integer math circuits are also VERY fast. But all things being equal, the extra work for floating point makes me feel pretty confident that its probably at least microscopically slower than integer math if you can actually do the same work using both types. It may take a billion plus repeated operations to show a meaningful difference when timing it, though. And repeated operations MAY skip the double conversion stuff, if you are working with the same entity over and over that would be optimized to have far less impact, so the actual task being tested matters a lot too.cache and bus stuff outside the CPU has an impact, and THERE, bigger is not better. Its a totally different conversation.Language does matter, at least somewhat. Or the compiler, and how good it is.

Shorts are for inherently small integers, like the x/y position of an item on a screen (but not a printer).Unless you’re doing down-to-the-metal image processing you’ll have a hard time measuring any differences in speed. Adds are fast, divides are slower, etc, for both. Are shorts (16-bit integers) slower than longs (32-bit integers)? They might be if they’re stored unaligned. You can read about that. But again, you’ll need to know a lot about assembly language and processor architecture to even measure the difference. We’re talking nanoseconds or less. If you have millions of them the space saving might help.

nr57lhd,"I wouldn’t stress about this — it’s the most extreme case of premature optimization. But the AI isn’t entirely wrong, it’s just answering a question that doesn’t matter for you.Modern CPUs are optimized for 32/64-bit operations, and short arithmetic can require extra sign-extension instructions. Float SIMD (SSE/AVX) is also absurdly well-optimized compared to integer SIMD. So in a tight loop doing pure math on individual values, floats can genuinely be faster per-operation.But that’s not what data-oriented design is about. The win from smaller types is memory bandwidth and cache — if you’re iterating over millions of values, smaller types mean more fit in a cache line, fewer misses, faster overall. The AI conflated ALU throughput with memory access patterns, which are completely different concerns.None of this matters unless you’re in a game engine’s hot path or crunching massive datasets. In normal application code, you’ll burn way more time on the code smells: constant casts when APIs expect int, subtle bugs from implicit narrowing, maintaining mental overhead about which precise type lives where.Constrained types absolutely make sense for semantic clarity though — using sbyte for a deck index or ushort for a port number communicates intent and gives you some compile-time bounds enforcement.

I am not sure what university you go to or how they teach it there, but in general I don't think they teach it very well and you certainly have not had enough classes to be this hard on yourself.OOP is not just a Java thing either. You can think of it as real life and that is why it is supposed to make sense once you understand that. Classes are just descriptions of things. Objects are instances of that description.Use animals as an example. Mammals are a class that describes things with hair. So, hasHair == true. Some mammals are land animals and some are sea animals. So, where == ""land | sea"". A lion (subclass) ""Inherits"" the attributes of a mammal and adds a few more attributes like sharp teeth. So, hasTeeth == true && hasBigTeeth == true && isDangerous == true :). A pig is a mammal too and it ""inherits"" from mammal too. Some of the attributes it shares with a lion has different values. If we were to control a lion or a pig we call the ""run"" function, the lion will have a faster run implementation than the pig. ""Polymorphism"". We typically hide the implementation and field access to make code less brittle. We would not want someone binding directly to something we want to be able to change later. We make these attributes and internal functions private. ""Encapsulation"". There should be a subclass of mammal that lion inherits from named ""LandAnimal"". Now this part gets tricky because Java does not support multiple inheritance so we want to use hasA vs isA implementation. When we access the base class LandAnimal which actually has the ""run"" method which is slower in pigs than in lions ""polymorphism"" again. LandAnimal is an ""abstraction"" (or base class) of Lion (isA LandAnimal). Or we can use interfaces for this ""abstraction"" (hasA LandAnimal) interface (composition).I just wrote this from the top of my head so I hope it makes sense and is correct.I hope this helps.

Just grinding won't get you further. Your brain will just get overloaded and shut down.A little story from my experience: when Java came out, I was already programming for over a decade and was proficient in multiple procedural languages. Then, I tried Java and OOP. This was a humbling experience. I could not make heads or tails at all. The *language* was easy enough to understand, but switching from procedural to OOP didn't click at all. I tried many times and failed many times until at one point, it suddenly started to make sense. Can't even say what really did it for me.Now, my advice is to program something with it and here, I deviate from the common examples: build a *library* for card games, like Blackjack, Poker, Uno, etc. Start with modeling a single `Card`. It has a suit, a rank, a numeric value, a face, a back, it can be face up or down - the fields. The card can report its data - provided it is face up, it can draw itself (in a loose sense), it can be flipped - toggle face up/down.Then, go further: make a `Deck` that can hold a full set of cards, that can be shuffled, that can deal cards, that can tell if it is empty or not, etc.Next, a `Hand` that takes cards.And so on.Build it in such a way that you can create different `Card` types, e.g. PokerCard, UnoCard, etc. All these can use the `Deck` without modification.With such an exercise, you'll cover abstract classes, inheritance, composition, polymorphism.

You also need to take some time off to exercise and get some fresh air because your brain won't work at its best if it is overwhelmed with stress. You have to let some of it out.

Pick something small for your first project but tie it altogether, frontend (html/css/js) to backend (java/database). You will get a lot more out of your university base knowledge this way.TODO is often dismissed as some little early learner frontend exercise. It can actually take you all the way to experienced full stack cloud developer (if you want to take it that far).Start the TODO frontend and make it fully responsive. For persistence, use localStorage (easier) or IndexedDB (harder) and create a JS ORM for persistence so you exercise these muscles. This will make it a fully functional todo list that works for that browser. From there add a backend with database. Modify your ORM to connect to the backend via REST. That will make it work in any browser (locally).Next turn it into a SaaS app with OAuth2 signup/login, member management, Stripe subscription processing, calendar scheduling, email reminders, SMS, CI/CD with automated testing and deployment.You will be able to build almost anything with the skills you learn through these TODO exercises.Start small and keep adding the next small thing to it. Add what you want to learn and let that be your guide. You will see progress as you go.Also, looking things up and figuring out how to solve problems is the main part of programming.

Are you asking if the win rate is too low to be fun, or are you asking if the program is behaving incorrectly?It's straightforward to calculate the exact probability of each possible outcome of a spin, and thereby calculate the probability of a win. One way to do this is by brute force: there are 116^3 = 1560896 possible outcomes, all equally probable, and you can write a program to count them up *without* randomness.With a little work, you can calculate the same win probability more efficiently, by avoiding repeatedly considering all the duplicate ways to get the same outcome.Of course, even if the probability of a win is 1/100, that doesn't guarantee that there will be exactly one win every 100 plays. The actual outcome is very likely to be higher or lower due to random variation. If you want to check your program for correct behavior, you can do a large number of runs (say, 10000) and then use an appropriate statistical test (such as a chi-squared test) to see where the observed number of wins falls, in comparison to the statistically likely range.I'm not a gambling expert, but I believe real slot machines don't *only* pay out if all of the symbols on a line match.

All methods are supposed to either return a value, or indicate that they do NOT return a value using the keyword `void`.

It sounds like you are going for a Computer Science degree, and wondering, why they don't teach you to be a programmer, but a scientist. Maths (and DSA and all theoreetical CS courses) are very much required to become a computer scientist. You have to learn all of the basics, so you are able to specialize in any CS subfield later. This also enables you to understand, to have a common vocabulary and knowledge base with others, even if they have a different specialization. I spezialized in computer graphics at uni. One of my best friends in networking and distributed computing. Although we barely had any courses in common after the first 2 years, we could talk to each other and explain one another what we were doing and how it works, with barely any problems. Those skill are not immediately, obviously useful. But they are necessary for computer science. And as someone who was a tutor for a DSA course: Those courses are there to give you the toolkit to reason about algorithms, analyze them and even figure out new ones if you need to. They don't teach you how to program, and that's by design. It is a different skill. Programming on the other hand is something completely different. It is a craft. The program doesn't care if you know Dijkstras Algorithm, can integrate in multiple dimensions or know the difference between average and median. If helps to know those things about as much as a knowledge of a structural engineer helps you building wooden cabins. Good to have? Sure. Can you learn it quicker and easier for this specific usecase? Also yes. If you want to learn programming, you will either have to hope that your school has some courses in that direction that will be helpful, or you will have to take your foundational knowledge (like maths and DSA), get some tutorials and get programming. >Should I choose a specific field of software engineeringNot 100% sure, but it sounds like you really should focus on the fundamentals first>I tried to read books on software designagain, fundamentals. You are trying to run before you can walk.

That is more or less everything you are expected to know as a junior developer anyways: You have the basics needed to produce code under guidance, and you have the background (CS degree) to learn fast, because concepts you will need are already somewhere in your brain.

So, choose whichever path seems best for you, but know that you have to get your schedule under control either way--especially with an accelerated, self-paced program. The Third option is getting a job first and either waiting a little bit or doing school simultaneously. This is tough, but also an excellent way to gain experience and get a feel for the job market and which degree program would suit you best.

Adding an api to support some new feature, along with implementing the front end is pretty easy. Previously those tasks were like 15% planning, 70% coding and 15% QA. Now it is almost entirely QA. It is legit boring but requires a smart human to make sure it works as expected and the code is maintainable. Rarely does claude code one shot things. Although I still do feature development, I have been shifting to harder problems. Finding slow memory leaks, building dev tools to address some inefficiencies, analyzing and addressing performance issues, optimizing our horrendously slow CI, devop stuff, etc. I still use ai for these harder problems but it involves a lot more human coding and intervention. These things felt a bit overwhelming before but now feel doable.... and they are fun.

If you have a professional network / connections, they are your best resource for getting past all the noise created by AI resumes and all the tactics that HR / recruiting departments are using to thin them out.A friend at another company said they just fired an offshore guy who they later found out had 6 jobs at the same time. That's what you're competing against, the noise of professional job applicants using every tool at their disposal.>Also, does anyone have experience applying for a TPM or manager position after being a software engineer? Thinking of pivoting.You need to pivot in place at your next employer, rather than try to pivot between jobs. It won't work, you have no experience in the role you're applying for. My advice would be to try to be your next team's Scrum Master, if they don't have one. Get the certs for that, get some experience, then look at pivoting again to Product Owner or TPM based on your preference.FYI these \^\^\^ roles are getting even worse for cold applications because all the offshore that can't code (or get their cousin who can code to do the interview for them) get scrum / PM certs instead. Every cert class I teach / attend has a disproportionate number of offshore attendees, most of whom couldn't create a dashboard in Jira to save their lives.Not to be irrationally negative about offshore but there's so much noise in the system right now that it's hard to match US workers to US jobs. I can't even get callbacks on ITAR / DoD jobs that get relisted 2-3 times, and these people were throwing all the money at me 3 years ago. The whole system is broken. Rely on your network.Edit: TPM, PO, Scrum Master, Agile Coach etc are all excellent places for former devs to go. Moving to coaching was the best thing for my career, as most of your competition won't even be close to your technical skillset.

It's not you, it's legitimately the market structure there.The masters pivot might not be the worst idea but... business degrees after CS can be weird. You'll be competing with people who did business undergrad and have that foundation already.

nroczm1,"I’m just a SWE 1, but I like to think I have a healthy relationship with AI coding right now. I use it for work daily, but I originally learned and got to where I am without AI.I mentor for lots of college hackathons and I see so many students like you, who are completely reliant on AI to code, and fail spectacularly. It is an **insane power move** (HAHA) when I pull up to a mentee, immediately close ChatGPT or ask them “how do you close cursor?”, skip over all the Google AI overview when I google stuff, and debug their thing “raw” old school and fix it either in 1 glance or in half the time they’ve been stuck in an LLM prompting circle.My advice? Learn without AI. AI is a force multiplier imo, it turns say a level 1 engineer into a level 2, and a level 10 into a level 20. The moment you let things go, you stop leveling up. There is a significant difference in quality and speed between “code me an api for an app” vs “implement an API with these exact 5 routes, implementation steps, pagination, specific auth middleware, database, other layers, and other architectural and security concerns/requirements.”TLDR: better you are, the more effective it will be.“Learning without ai??? That’s impossible.”Yeah yeah, I hear you. You want to be spoon fed everything relevant now. You want it fast and customized. You’ll be better reading and learning without AI, but yeah yeah, it will take longer. Remember that programming is supposed to engage your brain. But if you really want to learn with AI, which I totally get the temptation, here’s what I’ve been advising my mentees at least.It about aligns with how I learned without AI, but adapted to this new day and age:## Use AI as a guide, not as your driver.> in the past, I learned through documentation and stack overflow. I would try copy and pasting code, but it would rarely work without me understanding how it works and modifying it to work with my code.1. Let the AI guide you, not drive for you. Get off cursor or whatever. Do not auto approve changes. Review everything it proposes. Stop copy pasting ChatGPT code. Instead, read each line it proposes, understand what it does and why it does what it does. Never ever put the code in until you know what each line does. Research the documentation, the patterns, everything OUTSIDE of asking an LLM. Too many times, I’ve been burned by incredibly convincing hallucinations I blindly trust.**My company gives me Claude 4.5. I have coded with Gemini 3 in my spare time. Even then, a near top-of-the-line coding LLM isn’t perfect enough to fully vibe-trust for work and for mildly complex projects.**## Ask AI to cite its sources or give it the sources.> I learned everything by reading documentation2. If you ever let an LLM drive (rather, think) for you, ask it for QUOTED sources and links, OR plug in the relevant documentation yourself and then ask for direct quotes that inform its implementation. Then, go back and read that relevant section yourself. Only then, can you hit yes on the code. You’ll learn something, at least, while keeping some momentum and enhancing accuracy. Still—better to learn yourself and feed it what it needs rather than trust it.## Debug without an LLM> Debugging and making effective hypothesis and knowing how to test them is the best skill I’ve learned, and it’s helped me both with and without AI. Trial and error have helped build my intuition and propose ideas on why things aren’t working, and that’s built on a solid debugging strategy, tons of experience, and exploration. 3. Learn effective debugging skills. I’ve had so many situations where students debug via LLM by saying “it doesn’t work, fix it” or “it’s not smooth, fix it”. Instead, when you tell it “I identify a race condition, I’d like to refactor the code by XYZ” the LLM works actually pretty well. But to figure this out, you gotta know how to debug outside of an LLM. Sometimes, it may involve a big or novel switch in approach that an AI in its little rabbit hole cannot suggest. Also, being a code detective is the best part of programming imo, why would you offload the best part to an AI?TLDR: don’t turn off your brain and don’t trust anything the LLM says. Pretend it’s a con artist or scammer and double check everything yourself OUTSIDE of the LLM “scammer ring” scheme.",Idroxide,2025-12-01 07:36:30,19,cscareerquestions,t3_1pb4kf7,False,

nrj0pjf,"What does it mean to ""take their tech teams more seriously"" or to be ""more enjoyable""?For me ""take their tech teams more seriously"" means product management / leadership is not operating unchecked with development resources and racking up massive piles of tech debt, chasing some shallow quarterly target at the expense of (or worse, absence of) a longer term strategy/vision. Of the many questions I ask, I like to ask engineering managers / directors: ""What was the hardest conversation you've ever had with a stakeholder"". What I'm listening for in the manager's/director's response is:1. Have they ever told a stakeholder ""no"" or ""[yes, and](https://galenemanuele.com/blog/power-of-yes-and)"" (which is really just fancy ""no""). Unless they've been in leadership like ... 2-3 years ... an answer of ""huh, nothing comes to mind"" is a red flag for me. My read on that is they're very likely avoiding difficult conversations to the detriment of their team, because leadership is almost never sunshine and butterflies for everyone. Business is hard.2. What inputs lead to that difficult conversation? The team? A Jira board? An existential threat? Customer feedback? Data? Hopefully something more tangible than intuition alone.3. How did they tailor the conversation to this specific stakeholder's behaviors, values, and goals?And I often ask clarifying questions, or for them to elaborate, if I don't get 1, 2, and 3 covered in their initial response. Covering all 3 in the initial response is a big old green flag for me. I need to work with leaders who know how to ""go to bat"" for their people and advocate for what they believe is best for the business -- maybe that isn't as important to you. A big, big part of having a healthy engineering practice is telling important people ""no"" sometimes, even if they might fire you or advocate for your firing because you said ""no"". But they probably won't fire me, because I've already established through a different line of questioning that this leader values [psychological safety](https://psychsafety.com/psychological-safety-72-personal-user-manuals/).",healydorf,2025-11-30 12:05:18,13,cscareerquestions,t3_1pagdtk,False,

nrq9cw7,"Okay, a bit ranty but you are on to something. I have a good friend who has his masters and teaches regular and advanced history / social studies for highschool students, and he's had some uncomfortable insights about AIFor the first time since we've really been recording this information, my friend has been seeing an inverse bell curve; meaning the average score is no longer in the middle ~70%, there are two polar opposites: students that care and are trying, scoring 90%+ and those who just don't give a shit at all. So to give the younger generation some credit, there is a big group of students that see what tik tok and AI are doing to their attention span and are determined to succeed in spite of that. But there just as big of a cohort that are straight up turning off their critical thinking and letting AI take the wheel.Because critical thinking, making decisions really is the skill AI threatens to take away the most. Most of these failing students just refuse to put in any effort that requires them to think beyond a surface level.So to reiterate, this is genuinely new. This is different. Previous technologies like the Internet certainly changed education, but a huge emphasis was placed on digging beyond surface level Wikipedia details.

nr1r3bt,"So, broadly speaking, disagreeing is perfectly normal and in fact is strongly encouraged in healthy teams. Crucially though, both parties have to be disagreeing in a spirit of honest inquiry. They have to be listening to what the other person is saying and understanding why they have said it. In a properly functioning disagreement you will be asking as many questions as you will be giving answers.Eventually, you might get to a point where you both fully understand each other, but do just fundamentally disagree. At this point, you will typically involve a 3rd party (another colleague, a team lead) to give a fresh perspective, and to act as a tie-breaker. If you still can't come to a consensus after that, then your only option is to disagree and commit. A senior decision maker (e.g. a team lead) will pick one of the options, and you will all agree that, even if it's not your preferred option, you will commit to getting it done on the basis that doing the wrong thing well is often better than not doing anything at all.Key rules when disagreeing:1. Authority is irrelevant. If you can't explain and justify your view, your job title of Fancypants Principal Senior Architect is meaningless.2. Listen. Listen and understand what the other person is saying. Ask clarifying questions or suggest concrete examples if you don't.3. Go for a beer afterwards. This is the importance of relationships. I can have (sometimes quite forceful) disagreements with colleagues, but it is fine because we are also friendly with each other. Grab a beer, or a coffee, or have a game of pool, or whatever, but just build that relationship so it can easily survive disagreements.Finally, YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) is a common approach in software development, and it has it's place, but when it comes to security concerns you _are_ going to need it!",HiddenStoat,2025-11-27 13:11:35,13,cscareerquestions,t3_1p807h5,False,

I know how to do something in one language, so I how can I do something similar in this new language. There are obviously some languages that are different, but logic and optimizations/algorithms will always be somewhat consistent. You're also noting one reason why people go into management or leave the field. They get sick of having to keep learning things. I've had interviews with people where we discussed AI, and some people have a nuanced opinion on it. Not everyone thinks it will take over the world. And not everyone thinks it's garbage.

nr63g6w,"For ML engineering, I think Masters helps with that. But plenty of people get an MLE job even without a masters. MLE from what I gather is, SWE in the context of ML. There is an additional interview round for MLE jobs where they ask you ML trivia like ""what it is the difference between L1 and L2 normalization"" or ""Explain K-fold cross validation"". You may or may not get to do model development in an MLE job. But you will be involved in productionalizing an already developed model.For applied scientists type of a role though. I have seen a few of my batch mates get those type of roles with just a master's degree. There are a few caveats though.1. These roles were in Amazon. In Amazon Applied scientist role is more of a SWE role than an AS role from what I observed. Most of the Amazon Applied Scientist roles are not the same as Microsoft research Applied Scientist role or Google Brain Research scientist or even Facebook AI research applied scientist roles. A lot of Amazon AS people get to churn out research papers every year. But I have seen even MLEs churn out research papers as well.2. You need to have at least 1 publication even for the Amazon AS role, when applying from outside. A thesis in the Master's program helps with that.3. The school I attended was a top 20 school for CS back when I was applying. And a few of my Batchmates are now working as Applied scientists in Facebook and Amazon without a Ph.D with just a master's degree. And these were people on H1b. Not even US citizens. Your experience might not be the same however.Also applied scientist interviews are far more mathematical in nature than SWE/MLE interviews. You go into an interview and they might ask you to derive the expected value of a normal distribution or something on a whiteboard.

I call this the **”Carrier Pigeon model of Support” (tm)** and it’s terrible - customers are left thinking “why am i talking to this support person instead of the dev” and devs are left thinking “why is this person making my job harder”. It’s inefficient (latency due to relay) and ultimately makes everyone frustrated. Not falling into this antipattern is hard - customers will pester you (because they want cases solved faster), sales people will pester you (because they want their customer happy), and product/dev people will ignore you (because you’re bothering them and they have More Important Things (tm) to do). What a good Support Engineers does is equal parts social engineering (how do I get this person to help me when it’s not necessarily in their interest) and technical skill (troubleshooting whatever problem the customer has). Generally, I see the following in good Support Engineers:- They learn how to ask good questions - good questions are asked to the right person, in the right way, with the right information in such a way that *makes it as easy as is possible for the answerer to give a response*. Good Support Engineers ask for help from devs in a way that makes it easy to help them.- They manage expectations effectively - sometimes the customer should not be expecting an “urgent fix” for something that is at best a P2 feature request. Good Support Engineers set proper expectations with customers and only let customer urgency bleed onto Devs when its’s warranted.- They are self sufficient and proactive - good Support Engineers leverage resources, the access they have, and their troubleshooting skills to get information. They don’t bother devs about every single question. Thats not to say they never bother devs, but they try to dig up information on their own. Ditto on the proactive - a resource doesnt exist for some issue? They create it. Some issue is happening x times with a common pattern and the org is getting y support cases?

Also yeah it is true that a lot of the courses will probably have overlap with your undergrad, and look at [mymcit.org](http://mymcit.org) and look at the DS reviews - they aren't great.

Your DS undergrad combined with CS masters will make you unstoppable. It does not have to be brand name either. For example, SJSU is heavily recruited by big tech companies. So I would apply to all brand-name and non-brand name schools on west coast and see where you get in.

nrnjg03,"Recent hiring manager for software positions here.Hiring is a time consuming process. One of the things that sometimes gets forgotten is that hiring manager isn't a role. It's a temporary assignment on top of all of your regular duties until you find someone for the positions you have open. Let's just say that I'm already busy, and everything to do with hiring someone has to get fit in somehow but i still need to do the business activities that need doing.Let's start with resume review. I posted a job a month ago. I got somewhere in the neighbourhood of 30 new applicants per day and that was after the initial deluge of resumes. If you do a lot of resume screening, you can start to see whether a candidate has or doesn't have what you're looking for, but it still takes time. I started with a block of 10 resumes that looked good enough to book for a screening call. I booked all 10 in the next week. Nothing too onerous, but that's ten 30-minute calls to add to my schedule. that's 5 additional hours plus prep time, plus arranging said calls and answering the occasional questions from candidates while still screening even more resumes.Then perhaps i find someone that i want to talk to in person. That means finding basically a whole morning or afternoon to block off to interview them. Maybe i find a couple people. Maybe i don't. I fill up my hiring basket with about 10 hours of hiring activities our of my 40-hour week because again, i still have an actual job to do and there is only so much that can be done. The more in-person interviews i do, the less screening i can do. The more screening i can do, the less resume review i can do. Things get backed up to the point where some people you eventually get around to reviewing aren't available anymore.I'm not saying anything about a particular company or companies. You asked a general question, I'm giving you a general look behind likely many managers' calendars. It takes time and there are more applicants than there is time to process them. It would be swell if that weren't the case, but for me at least, it is.It's nice to think that it's simple: if someone doesn't get back to you within two weeks then to heck with them. That probably could be true for a lot of people for different reasons, but it doesn't mean it's out of malice. Someone like you could have been #78 on my list and I'm still in the 50's.

A recruiter took about 3 weeks to reach out to me, and their email responses always took a couple days. It wasn't a great experience, but it did give some food for thought. Then there are companies that move at lightning quick speeds.
