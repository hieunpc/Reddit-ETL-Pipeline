o5unagf,"I sort of like a bit of lake and a bit of warehouse. A common loading pattern we have been using is:- for streaming: source --> Kafka --> snowflake (snowpipe streaming to tables)- for batches: source --> AWS s3 (~lake) --> snowflake (external tables)- in both cases once in Snowflake: raw staged tables (bronze) --> structured, type-cast, deidentified views (silver) --> Kimball/star/mart views with metadata (gold)I've been liking this system so far. The key difference with streaming and batch in the above cases are that the batch method keeps the raw/bronze data in s3 via external tables, so I guess that's a ""lake"", while the streaming method loads the CDC events into a table resting in the snowflake data warehouse. We use dagster to orchestrate and dbt to run the jobs. The technologies are good - the challenges are behavioural in nature.There's probably a more consistent way to do the above, but it does work. I guess the lake/s3 component just exists because it is simple and cheap to read from some provided s3 dump than to add a ""copy into"" step. We would probably would have done the same for streaming, but snowpipe streaming is a good enough solution at the moment so we can skip a redundant intermediate load to s3.",PossibilityRegular21,2026-02-17 11:50:58,56,dataengineering,t3_1r73l52,False,

Model the infrastructure (make it modular and scalable), create some processes, and give power to the people within some defined boundaries. It’s more work, but I feel it’s easier — after inital cost I can go do streaming, swap out tools, optimize DB tables, create alert systems and stuff.Plus the experience managing your own files, metadata, debugging fucking notebooks is atrocious.

Still the hardest part.- Pipeline maintenance burden. Different failure modes now (API rate limits vs disk space), same percentage of time spent on it.- Stakeholder expectations vs data quality reality.What's genuinely better:- Getting started is 10x easier. A junior can have a working pipeline in a day instead of weeks.- The tooling for testing and observability actually exists now.- Version control for transformations is standard, not exotic.The 'Downfall' article was prescient about platform engineering eating some DE work.

You satisfy the current needs and start working on things you think are important or necessary to do what they ask you to do (reporting, dashboarding).

o4uz1fb,"When you say the AI team is piggybacking on your work, that would sound like you’re doing some data engineering in order to feed their models/LLMs, but if that’s not the case- then how does that situation look?How do these ad-hoc dashboards look? Are you just writing one off queries on raw data to populate them? In my experience ad hoc reports are a symptom of a lack of good models (and pipelines that build those models) going into your BI tools. If that’s the case it’s a pretty easy sell to your line manager that building a proper pipeline would mean dashboards get built faster and have way more reusability.If you’re the solo data engineer, then you’re the sole authority and the only one who can explain why it is a problem. Have you raised this with them? If you’re just complying with the requests of things they think they want to see, then they’re gunna be stuck in a loop of forcing through ad hoc things - because it’s all they know.You mention being an excel support desk too - this definitely shouldn’t be happening - spreadsheets can be avoided in almost all cases these days (with some exceptions). I LOVE it when someone requests a spreadsheet because it’s an opportunity for me to ask them “out of curiosity” what are they doing with the spreadsheet - then you almost always get given an opportunity to solve a problem that they didn’t even know existed, this can make people very happy and that’s the most satisfying part of this job, I find.Maybe I’ve got the completely wrong take here but it sounds like the company hasn’t been exposed to a modern data stack before and are doing things the old way, if you’ve already shown them how it could be better (time optimisation, data reliability, and undiscovered insights being the selling points that execs hear) - then fair enough leave - if you haven’t you’re sitting on a golden opportunity, cause it sounds like you’re the only authority.

o5b4ofe,"Both approaches have their place but the context matters a lot. I've built ETL pipelines both ways over 12+ years.Minimizing dependencies makes sense when you're building something simple and stable that won't need much maintenance. We had a batch job that ran for 8 years with zero external packages beyond requests and psycopg2. Worked great.But rebuilding ORM patterns from scratch is different from just not using one. If you're writing your own query builders, connection pooling, retry logic, and type coercion, you're now maintaining all that code forever. Every bug fix, edge case, and security patch is on you. SQLAlchemy has had hundreds of contributors finding problems you'll never think of.The return code pattern concerns me more than the dependency choice honestly. Python's exception model exists for a reason and fighting it creates code that's harder to read and debug. If your senior prefers explicit error handling, that's fine, but there are Pythonic ways to do it without making every function look like C.The real question is what's the maintenance horizon here. If this is a one time data migration that runs and gets archived, vanilla Python is fine. If this is production infrastructure your team will maintain for years, the cost of rolling your own ORM will compound. Every new team member has to learn your custom patterns instead of reaching for documentation.Worth having a direct conversation about it. Ask what specific concern drives the no dependencies stance.

I had nobody telling me no, I just communicated to IT what I was doing and got their blessing in email to cover my ass.Aside from that, I think I was also pretty strict about choosing libraries. I try to stick to stuff that's in the Anaconda suite since it seems to get a buttload of community and support.If a vendor has their own libraries that they actively maintain, I'll use those. If it's a real niche thing by some dude and I can't find a way to feel good about it, hell no. I've never had anything bad happen, but it only takes one time. I don't think my situation is a very good comparison. Nobody was really supporting me or looking at my work. I just packaged code where I could reference a config file like a control table. Send queries, save them as flat files, do the things like package them into this or that or upload them here or there.I was never given the greenlight for an actual database, but it got us by in the interim as we grew. Again, my situation was very specific with weird constraints.If your senior dev dude is having you basically write your own stuff instead of using a library, take that is a chance to reverse engineer a process that many might take for granted. A few years from now you'll be that much more versed in things I guess? Like, I had nobody to review my code. If anyone had to go back and look at it, it was me.

In interviews you’re expected to “compile in your head,” which is a different skill.What helped me was practicing a small set of patterns until they felt automatic. Things like group by with aggregations, joins across 2 to 3 tables, window functions for ranking or deduping, and basic subqueries. If you’ve internalized those shapes, most questions are just variations.Also practice explaining your thinking out loud while you write. Even if the query isn’t perfect, interviewers often care more about how you reason about edge cases and data shape. If you blank, start by restating the tables and columns you have, then sketch the result you want.

I'd say without a doubt you made the right choice to focus on SWE over DS. The thing you actually get in DS is about Statistics-with-programming and how to properly employ research against data. All good things, not really what we're concerned about with DE. 2. Since you're in SWE and looking at design patterns, keep in mind what it would be like if the only thing you had to care about was the data inside the objects. A lot of folks coming from a SWE background focus on the abstract object versus what is contained by the object. To move to DE you have to care a lot more about the latter. 3. Things that will be evergreen in DE: python, SQL, databases, warehouses, data modelling (although the meaning of this varies person to person, company to company, much to my chagrin). Focus on these. Python at an expert level (focus on the data packages. Polars, Duckdb. And DB packages. Pscyopg, etc.), at least 1 RDBMS 1 NoSQL and 1 DB system you're just interested in, SQL to an expert level which will give you passable knowledge for most Warehouses as well. 4.

I work with data teams and use Claude Code daily, so let me share what actually matters.The vibe coding thing you're seeing is real for building quick demos and web apps. But for analytics engineering work, especially in niche domains with messy data like you describe, it doesn't work that way. The hard part of your job is not writing SQL, it's knowing which parameter to look at based on domain knowledge. That's exactly where AI struggles.Where AI actually helps me is the tedious stuff. Debugging weird errors, generating boilerplate tests, converting between formats. I'd say 6/10 useful is about right for debugging help. Where it falls apart is anything requiring judgment about your specific business [context. My](http://context.My) honest take after a year of heavy Claude usage for data work is that the people who are no longer doing anything technical are probably working on much simpler problems than yours. When you're eyeballing raw files to figure out which field is correct because documentation doesn't exist, there's no prompt that replaces that institutional knowledge.Try Claude for the parts of your job you already know how to do but find tedious.

Not know what is the desired end result, or stakeholders not knowing what they want and you having to guess that is not. It's not clear to me what is the situation here, but you can use AI for both:- use AI to generate documentation of where each parameter/column is, what it describes, how to query it, etc. Review that documentation for mistakes/errors and rewrite/fix what needs to be fixed in the documentation. Then, the AI can refer back to this documentation when generating code, saving you time- ask AI to clarify requirements, or identify information gaps, and draft responses to requests that are not clearUsing AI to code is fine and useful, but you said that's not the part you struggle with.

o514svl,"The way that I have ended up managing Data Infra in a couple of roles now is by being able to rapidly produce a prototype. You'll want to pick up, and use regularly, systems like Docker and Kubernetes. Even for your own small data projects. This will introduce you into that world where those things are heavily used. These are also cloud-agnostic meaning no matter what service provider your future employer(s) use you'll be squared on this front. In the same vein are things like VPCs and general networking which I spend more time debugging than anything else in DE/DataOps. After that you can get into the specifics of particular platforms. As far as practicing is concerned: Start with `docker`. Learn the ins and outs of taking arbitrary python code you have and stuffing it into a container. Learn how to find images, how Dockerfiles work, run into the issues so you can troubleshoot them. Then see what it takes to incorporate tools you may be using to develop your code into the dockerfiles. Things like `uv`. If you can have one system managing both your local dev and your container builds you have less points of failure to troubleshoot. Then grab `k3s` for local development. This is, notably, ""actual"" kubernetes. That is opposed to things like minikube which are ""kubernetes in docker"". Nothing wrong with that, but when we're talking about ""rapid"" prototyping, k3s is as close as it gets to just managing raw k8s on your local system. You'll probably immediately want to grab `helm` as well. Read up on `k8s`, `k3s`, `helm`, and `kubectl`. Play around with trying to get your docker containers that do things or expose things up onto k3s locally. See what it takes to setup `postgres` on kubernetes, and how to expose it so you can communicate with it externally.Outside of those things, which are more typical of `self host first` shops, you can likely find playgrounds around specific tech. I believe `databricks` recently opened up a playground of sorts. Snowflake may as well, but I don't honestly remember. Google on `GCP` used to give you like $300 in credits, plus they have the open BigQuery datasets you can mess around with. I think all of these things are secondary or tertiary things to focus on though, as they are mostly provisioned and managed for you from an infra standpoint. It's not bad to see what the platforms look like behind the scenes, though!I find Data infra specifically very interesting.

The math is nontrivial. Linear algebra, especially rotation matrices and quaternions for coordinate transforms, and the Newtonian equations you'd learn in a 1st year calculus based physics class, and also a bunch of other stuff that I had to learn/relearn to work here. (I have an undergrad degree in math.) I don't have to *implement* everything, but I do need to understand what's going on conceptually and use appropriate mathematical libraries correctly.2. The folks I work with are PhDs, so a lot of building a pipeline is listening, very carefully to what the (let's say) rocket scientist wants and building exactly that. No creative metrics here. The physics is the physics. I ask a lot of questions about what is supposed to happen through a series of calculations. What does a good result and a bad result look like? Where are the best places along the way to spot-check things like an intermediate matrix becoming ill-conditioned?3. The PhD's are not hired for coding ability. I need to detangle messy MATLAB code to turn into data pipelines that I actually want to own and maintain over time.I work on the ""easy"" stuff that still fits in a Postgres database. So, I use python and other fairly standard tools. I want to upskill into rust/pyO3 which I'd hope would make some of the calculations complete faster than numpy/scipy. I suspect I do a lot more software engineering than my retail data engineer peers: There is a lot of custom code written specifically for our particular uses/devices that just isn't available in open source libraries or even as a commercial product (besides the stuff sold by my employer and our direct competitors).",MissingSnail,2026-02-16 04:09:42,3,dataengineering,t3_1r59ivo,False,

I have another question then: if we wouldnt use linked servers what else would you propose so dbt in the dev environment has the same data pretty much at the same time as the prod environment. We also have 20-40 api scripts through azure functions ingesting to bronze prod. And a couple of bigger source systems that ADFs copy activity handles. But i wouldnt want to clone stuff and insert everything twice. Also the DDL statements to create and prepare th tables for dev ingestions would be needed twice too. Should we backup and redeploy the prod bronze db maybe after each time? Is Linked Servers really a bad option and what do you mean with cross env drift and permission weirdness?

o5slfxl,"The VIEW union approach works but watch out for a gotcha you might hit. When Pandas infers types from Postgres it sometimes gets more specific than PySpark did, especially with numeric precision and timestamps. You end up with timestamp with tz vs without, or int32 vs int64, and the UNION fails.What worked for us was adding a casting layer in the raw zone specifically for the new ingestion path. Basically land the data as-is into a staging table, then have a simple transform that casts everything to match the old schema before it hits the raw layer the VIEW references. Keeps the VIEW logic clean.On question 2, if you are switching to the new ingestion permanently anyway you might consider letting the new types be canonical and backfilling the old data with a one-time cast migration instead of maintaining two type systems forever.

o5slhvs,"One way to cobble this together is when the data type drifts, retain the most permissive data type. For example, if the old is a varchar and the new is an int, use varchar - you can implicitly convert any int into varchar but there's no way of getting non-numeric varchars into ints. The downside of this is that you're losing the benefit of having an appropriate data type, so you're probably going to use more storage and invite unoptimised behaviour by downstream tooling.Another consideration is whether the old data will actually change at all. Using our example, if the historic data was stored as varchar but you can query to confirm all the values can be converted to int, simply do that in the view. You would only want to do this if you're sure that the historic data is static though, because if not you're inviting a failure condition if anyone puts non-numeric data in the varchar.",fauxmosexual,2026-02-17 02:03:46,4,dataengineering,t3_1r6sw5j,False,

Define the types of the temp table to match your data from python then cast to the desired types in the query that copies from temp to target. Another benefit of that is that the copy query can join or anti-join with the target table to implement upsert or insert-ignore logic.Instead of the join view I would recommend copying the old data to the new table and then just appending it with new data.",Atmosck,2026-02-17 02:13:13,3,dataengineering,t3_1r6sw5j,False,

o5kajsq,"The data engineer role will provide technical fundamentals that are more scalable for future roles.The business analyst is a strange frankenstein position. In practice it appears to exist to try and create a role with emphasis on domain expertise to try and improve processes but without the salary premium in an investment in technical skills that would be required of a data analyst or other professional data roles. Sort of a what if there were a halfway business admin career level and a data analyst at a professional career level, but we can pay them cheaper. As result they tend to become data specs retrievers.Where I call this a frankenstein role is because in practice when you do work the slow boring way, the technical details, that is where the pattern recognition develops. To see the insights in terms of what steps in the process can be eliminated. Where to break it into logical steps and streamline and automate. That technical work at the data analyst or more technical roles is where innovation happens, closest to the doing of the work. This is partly observation that in the industrial era it was common that those associates closest to the manufacturing lines would then observe a process improvement and go on to start a second business using those improved processes as a foundation. As we are in the tech white collar era the same principles appear to apply that those closest to the work observe pattern simplifications that innovate. In order to develop the intuition to improve processes there is no replacement for having performed that process. By doing so with time in a role a data analyst or other data positions tend to also develop domain expertise along with their technical skills.Thus from my perspective what companies want from a business analyst requires experience in more technical roles, first. And this is what you see in more mature companies. The business analyst tends to be more of a senior data professional at a salary premium. As a senior data professional they have the technical background to consult on improved business processes and speccing out those projects.There are a lot of companies staffing business analysts that are at a much more junior level. Creating oddities in data on what they should be paid and ambiguities in how to implement them within the company structure.You get to skip that ambiguity by transition to a more defined data role with development of fundamentals that transition to other roles and scale.",decrementsf,2026-02-15 20:02:02,1,dataengineering,t3_1r5n10y,False,
o5yv0nw,"Unlikely, but there will be effects. First, it's not going to take all DE jobs. In my experience so far, AI is an enabler, not a replacer. It can do some pretty amazing stuff *in the right hands*. You still need a trained and experience DE in order to use the tools properly. Joe from accounting is not going to be building advanced pipelines from his finance system to run his reports anytime soon. Tony in the warehouse isn't going to be building well designed databases to track his company's inventory movement, etc.Having said that, and again, my personal experience (About 15 YOE as SWE, DE, now Architect), is that companies may not need as many people, especially juniors, as they did before. The truth is I save many hours per week now pushing basic work to AI which frees me up to do more complex design stuff. Things like transcribing field lists in JSON or Excel to SQL CREATE TABLE statements, generating DAX queries so I don't have to look up the syntax (I still check all code), even fairly complex data transformations that might have taken me a couple of hours before I can now do in minutes, which includes validating the code that comes back.The main point is that AI is not doing things I couldn't otherwise do, it's just making me do them a lot faster, and I think that's the big thing people miss. A non-DE could not do my job, or yours, even with an AI. I know we've all seen those demos where someone unskilled builds an app in an hour or a day and publishes it, but those are all simple apps that aren't that useful. Throw something harder at them, like adding authentication and multiple uses to that cute little time tracker and they fall apart. Complex tasks still require skilled personnel, and I don't see that changing.So yeah, there will still be jobs, but I think there's going to be a lot of disruption over the next 3-5 years as AI settles in (and the current purge of COVID over hiring plays out) until things settle down. Our jobs might look different, but we'll still have them.

I've done a lot of VBA and though I like other tools more, I know I can build high quality, durable, readable tools. I had some good, simple VBA programs that I later built into VB.NET versions. Next, when building a pipeline, pay very close attention to the input end and output end. Make sure you understand exactly what is coming in and going out. Your job is to build the bridge.You have another tool that gives you a lot of options and will serve you well in your future: PowerShell. Every Windows system has it and it exists outside the VBA/MS Office universe. You can call VBA from outside Office apps and you can use a wider range of shell commands when you call PowerShell from within VBA. You can even use .NET from PowerShell. I don't have a particular suggestion, but it's another tool within your narrow non-developer permissions.As a technique, check out whether OOP is a better approach. Some VBA developers never go there but building custom classes often solve problems that otherwise are needlessly clumsy and unintuitive. You'll look more professional and your project will be easier to move to a better platform if it is organized around sensible classes than if it is built around .com objects that aren't built around your needs.",BrupieD,2026-02-16 15:26:29,3,dataengineering,t3_1r5wkl0,False,

The instruction files can't encode business logic deep enough to prevent that.What actually works: dbt's built-in tests get you maybe 30% there. The wins come from singular tests that encode your actual business rules, stuff like 'revenue should never be negative' or 'customer count should be within 5% of yesterday.' We run those on every PR.We also started requiring example queries with expected outputs in PR descriptions. Manual, yeah, but reviewers can run them and verify the logic. Caught more issues than any linter.The sneaky pattern with AI-generated dbt is syntactically valid code that does the wrong thing with joins or nulls. We added a TESTING.md file listing these gotchas and requiring specific test coverage for them.For open source where you can't control what people use, CI becomes the only guardrail.

We’ll likely see a knock-on effect of even cheaper compute as all these data centers are built to meet a demand for AI will inevitably to drop off.In the short- to medium-term, there’s probably a pretty penny to be made by contractors who can untangle the mess of code written by companies who went overboard on writing their software with AI.So I guess TL;DR is that if you’re a total AI Luddite you should probably at least experiment with AI to get used to where it’s helpful and where it isn’t. If you’re an AI hype beast, you should probably make sure not to let your actual technical skills atrophy because the future where AI writes 100% of the code is just not coming.

People like you do not send your CVs, LinkedIns, Githubs, etc. Or they hesitate a lot before they start applying to places.Then there are people who do send but visibly are not confident during the interview. I do not mean that one should start lying and exaggerating things but I mean, be confident in what you know and in what you do not know. ""Yeah, I do not know frontend development but I'm considering learning it."" or ""I'm a backend developer but having to do frontend tasks seems to be a good challenge."" I have told these. Not during interviews but during 1:1s when I was moved to a fullstack position. And my boss was fine. Because she saw that I actually show an interest in improving myself. If I would be ""I'm worried about frontend tasks. I really hope I will not get any of these. Backend tasks are much safer bet."" then that would be bad. Lack of confidence, no wish to grow, perhaps even stagnation.Then lack of confidence when being on probation period. Cool, you got hired! You passed all these interviews. But the next 2-5 (however long time period) months are also critical. Either you pass the probation period or the company has to tell that ""Sorry. We considered it but we do not see how things will progress from here."" Perhaps different countries have different laws and such, but where I live, a person is put on a ""test period"" of a couple of months before his contract is finalized (meanwhile the contract is temporary). So, some juniors, they are not confident. They do not ask questions. They do not share their thoughts. They do not participate in discussions over new tasks and such. They get stuck and do not voice it out. They start comparing themselves with younger colleagues who have been in the field for longer time, then get some irrational fears, and let it affect themselves even more negatively.What I'm trying to say: this field indeed is difficult. But one should be confident in himself. Have a growth mindset. When you see you are lacking in something do not see it as a weakness but see it as an opportunity to learn new things.

o5k3dwc,"Professional software developer here, and I agree with everything you've said. Building on your post, here's an analogy from my own experience that I think supports your point:I learned to write code before I learned to cook. I was equally interested/enamored by each of these skills when I first started to learn them.One of the first things I learned to cook was [stir fried chicken with rice noodles][stir-fry]. For at least a month, I made this dish several times per week. This repetition afforded me space to observe and learn - I noticed when the color of some ingredients started to change in the cooking utensil (an observation I wasn't previously able to make). I started adding other ingredients to the dish because I had learned some intuition (which gave me confidence that even if my didn't turn out great, it wouldn't be terrible) over repeated exposure. Slowly, I was able to rely on visual cues without needing to set a timer (""hey! the broccoli is starting to look like it's cooked"" instead of ""it's coming up on 3min, time turn down the heat""). This is how I learned how to cook and how to understand what I was seeing on the stove. Prior to this, I had watched many cooking shows/videos and family and friends had even tried to show/teach me - all of this was ""tutorial hell"" and I never felt like I knew what I was doing. One lesson from this experience is that ""know what you're doing"" doesn't come before you build something for the first time. It's actually the other way around - you learn by doing stuff. When I say that, I am reminded of providing tech support for my grandma. She'd always be afraid that she was going to accidentally break something. This is a real concern with programming languages - you could potentially delete files or crash your OS through some bug. But starter/learning projects rarely expose you to that functionality. If you're still afraid, consider using a virtual machine. It wasn't until I read this post, OP, that I made the connection between this cooking practice and something else I did when I was learning to write code (back in 2007 - I'm old, I guess). After I first learned python, I would often (and for no real reason other than ""I like to write code"") write a decimal to binary function in python. Sometimes it would take me a long time to write (30min was not uncommon), sometimes I'd write it in a few minutes. The point was never to write it quickly to ""beat my personal record"". The point was always to practice this new skill. Sometimes I'd write it recursively, sometimes I'd try something different.But this repeated practice did for me, the same thing that repeatedly cooking the stir fry did. I was able to study different ways of solving the same problem and hone my understanding of how python works. Now, I didn't write my decimal to binary converter every day - I think the most frequently I did this was ""once a week"" for a few weeks (then, about once a month, and I eventually started to use it to test whether I liked a new keyboard). At the time for me, it was like re-reading my favorite passage out of my favorite fiction book (the was before Netflix, so that might translate today as ""rewatching my favorite episode of a TV show"").That's really the secret sauce - practice for familiarity. When I use LLMs today, the value for me is that the LLM writes the code. The time savings for me comes from not having to physically type out the code. The thinking that goes into it beforehand (what architecture to use, what algorithm to use, what data structures to use, how to model the data flow and problem solving, etc; If I haven't yet made these decisions, I have a conversation with the LLM to help me decide) - I communicate all of that to the LLM and let it do very little beyond writing the code I described.It does feel counterintuitive that learning to write code requires as much time and practice, because this learning time is often compared to learning other skills that require more time and practice to acquire and gain proficiency in. The key realization is that while learning to write code is faster than (say) learning to become a neurosurgeon, it still takes a lot (nowhere near zero) of time and effort. And while the proficiency threshold to make a meaningful contribution is lower than in many other professions, that threshold is not a plateau - the proficiency curve does go a lot higher and I think this might be one reason why beginners often get a wide range of feedback (from experienced developers with a wide range of proficiency levels)Ok I took a couple of rambling tangents (sorry, it's Sunday afternoon), but the takeaways are:1. repeated exposure and practice are the key to escaping tutorial hell1. the proficiency threshold to ""build something"" is much lower to escape tutorial hell than it is to (for example) contribute to an existing project in a professional or opensource capacity1. the probability of accidentally making a catastrophic error is very low1. the notion that repeated exposure improves proficiency is not new (my cooking story), thought that's maybe more of a ""hard truth"" than a ""comforting fact"" as I had originally intended it to be[stir-fry]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8f752SdeAI",inspectorG4dget,2026-02-15 19:25:55,5,learnprogramming,t3_1r53h5t,False,

o52mw72,"Arrays in JS are closest to what’s called an “ArrayList” in Java. The use of a contiguous memory layout, as well as enforcement of homogenous contents, are both secondary aspects of what makes something an array. An array is an ordered data structure which has (close to) constant time access to its contents by index. It’s better to think of these data structures in terms of the performance guarantees they provide for different operations than to try to focus on their implementations. Implementations can involve all sorts of hairy performance optimizations which obscure the intent of the data structure.The weird thing about JS arrays, and ArrayList objects compared to something like C or Java’s primitive arrays, is that they allow the data structure’s size to efficiently dynamically grow. The other weird thing about JS arrays is that they can be sparse, but that’s something you hopefully will never have to deal with. To be pedantic, it’s pretty common for arrays to “hold” heterogenous contents in languages other than JS. I use scare quotes because arrays of objects generally don’t hold objects themselves, but rather pointers to those objects. In languages with subtyping (like Java) the pointers may indeed point to multiple different types of objects as long as they are all subclasses of the array’s declared generic argument. A typed language like Java thus allows arrays to hold heterogenous data, but requires you to access the data as though it is homogenous (unless you use an unsafe downcast). Dynamically typed languages like JS and Python are more permissive, but it’s (IMO) a difference of degree, not a difference of kind.",josephjnk,2026-02-12 23:36:20,16,learnprogramming,t3_1r389j6,False,

The important part is the ""sequential"" part. You can look things up by index, and the items appear in predictable slots. Contrast with an ""associative array"" (no analogue in vanilla C, `Map` (and arguably `{}`) in JS, `Map` in Java). These are non-sequential. You look up by key, not by index.

Most languages have a built in **Array Data** ***Type***, and most of them uses that to implement some version of an **Array Data** ***Structure*** \- but JavaScript does not.When you declare an array in JavaScript, eg. `const data = [1,2,3,4,5]` \- the language gives you an Array Data **Type**, that you can use with indexes and `.length` and `.indexOf` and a lot of other helper methods. And this *can* be used as an Array Data **Structure** if you want to, but it can also be used as a lot of other Abstract Data Structures, e.g. a **List**, a **Stack**, a **Queue**, and even a **Map** (or Dict) as long as you limit yourself to using integers as keys.

o555hor,"> Is it more important that arrays are index-based by their definition more than it is important that they are homogeneous?Sort of, but I think you might also want to unwind your idea of homogeneity a bit. In Javascript, everything is pretty much the [Any type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_type), which in other languages may be called things like `Object` or `interface{}` or `void*`. So it's entirely expressible as a type, and as such the array is homogenously `array[Any]` or however you'd want to express the type.The other thing is that pretty much any language has some affordance for creating some sort of union, which you can then use in arrays. It will vary how ergonomic and error-prone it is, but in any case you can cook up an array of data that holds heterogenous base types.As in, you can define some union of integers and floats and put that in an array, which will be homogenous in that it only accepts that union and rejects stuff like strings, objects, etc; at the same time it'll be heterogenous in that you'll need to have some way of knowing which of the types in the union a given entry is.So the idea of homo/heterogeneity can be misleading,* because any sort of collection will always be homogenous if it's well-typed: all the elements in some collection `C[T]` are of type `T`* but may still be heterogenous in terms of base types: `T` may be a union of `T1 | T2 | …`",syklemil,2026-02-13 10:43:10,3,learnprogramming,t3_1r389j6,False,

Which is to say, they can be considered overengineering for a program of this size & scope, but overengineering otherwise small programs can also be a decent way to learn about those engineering practices.*Avoiding ""magic"" numbers*: Your `else` case for the difficulty rating is meant to result in `easy` mode, but this can drift apart. If you decide to give `easy` mode 4 tries for example, then you need to update that number in two spots. There are a couple of ways around that, like storing the numbers in constants, e.g. `const int EASY_MODE_TRIES = 3;` and then using the constant rather than the literal number, and/or having an extra parsing step where you wind up doing something like an extra function that ends on `else { cout << ""Something…""; return EASY; }`, returning something like an `enum` of the valid difficulty ratings, or even a struct. Error handling and parsing user input can be kind of big topics with lots of options.But generally, magic numbers are a hazard for code maintenance, because it very often turns into questions like ""why is it _this_ number? can I change it? what happens if I do?"" and some constants with names and rationales go a long way to alleviate that.*More functions*: Generally we break code up into what's hopefully logical chunks. Often to avoid repetition, but also sometimes just to break up long reams of code into something more like a condensed sequence of subtasks. Opinions vary on how long a function should be allowed to get. My opinion is something like trying to be able to fit the entire function on the screen (but also not trying to bend over backwards to follow the rule), which I think is a fairly common middle-of-the-road opinion.There are also a whole bunch of C++ concepts and best practices that you'll kind of have to pick up over time; one that may be good to get you to look into as soon as possible is ""[const correctness](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/const-correctness)"".",syklemil,2026-02-12 13:17:14,1,learnprogramming,t3_1r2p4i0,False,

Perhaps your next lesson will introduce functions to you, and this will dry up. std::transform(difficulty.begin(), difficulty.end(), difficulty.begin(), ::tolower);There is a bug here. It's really technical and subtle, and I don't fully understand it myself, but the [reference documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/byte/tolower.html) warns you this is unsafe, that you need to write a function that casts your character type to `int`. random_num = rand() % max_num + 1;This is the same in every branch of your difficulty condition. Just hoist it out and write this code once, after the condition block. std::getline(std::cin, guess); // Take guess as string user_guess = std::stoi(guess); // Convert string to integerToo many steps! Streams know how to extract integers! Your problem is interleaving extraction with line grabbing.The rules of extraction are:1) Ignore leading whitespace2) Start grabbing characters3) Stop at some delimiter character. Leave the delimiting character behind, in the stream.The rules for line grabbing are:1) Grab characters one at a time2) Stop when you find the delimiter character, discarding it.So imagine first extracting an `int` - something like `"" 123\n""; the stream purges the leading whitespace, grabs ""123"" and leaves ""\n"" behind. Now you line grab, and what happens? We grab ""\n"", which is our delimiter, and we stop.So the thing to do is know when you're switching between the two, and `ignore` the newline as necessary. int x; std::string s; std::cin >> x; std::cin.ignore(); // Purge after extraction, before getline std::getline(std::cin, s); std::getline(std::cin, s); std::cin >> x; // No purge necessary after getlineAnother thing you should be doing is checking your streams. A stream is implemented as a ""user defined type"", which are made from `class`, `struct`, `enum`, and `union`. One of the things you can do is ""overload"" almost any of the language operators. That's how `operator >>` and `operator <<` - the bit shift operators, are made to work as stream extraction and insertion - they're written as functions that work with stream types. And when you learn to make your own types, you can write your own stream operators for them without having to modify the stream class itself - the pattern is extensible.Continued...",mredding,2026-02-12 15:35:47,1,learnprogramming,t3_1r2p4i0,False,

You have to do that in such a way that you carve out safe rails for junior engineers to work along and good bones to respond to often chaotic business needs. Don’t discount the degree to which that will strengthen you technically.It sounds like you are an experienced mid level engineer but a pure focus on directly improving your own technical skill will hold you back.

Different build tools whether they are used in JavaScript, Java, C/C++, all follow some standard folder structure. Most Java projects are built with Gradle, Maven, or Ant and the Java folder structure is pretty rigid among these. Cmake for C/C++ is less picky about folder structure as your program's include statements control much of that. React, Svelte, and many JavaScript frameworks also use their own folder structure. Even Rebar3 for Erlang has a fairly fixed structure it uses.Build tools automate building of final product code so they expect certain files to be in certain places. These can be changed in the build configuration, but then working with a team used to standard structure can be chaotic. Also, many build tools will create the folder structure when you request a new project to be built.So, if you are building projects within a team or for a business, the folder structure will likely be mandated and essential. Even if you are planning to share a project, using a standard folder structure is still highly recommended.

For me that was low-level graphics. I sincerely believe the exact technologies are not vital for internships, rather it's about showing your appetite for learning. Knowing OS fundamentals, and having practical projects with memory management, and cache-awareness in mind already knocks the majority of competitors out, especially for internships if you are targeting low-level domain (most go for latest and greatest shiny deployable frameworks).If backend is referring to servers, databases, and interfacing with web, I have no idea.

I believe you don't really ""study"" programming. Rather, you start with something you want to create.

I understand the ""feeling lost"" emotion well. My gateway was a 3D graphics course using Direct3D and reading various old and new blogs of seasoned graphics programmers, even when I barely understood most and half understood some.

I didn’t have a map for my programming career initially, but I’ve learnt that adapting is the best strategy for my own path. I wasn’t familiar with computer science at all growing up, despite having a father who was a programmer. I tried to go to college but dropped out to protect my grades. Then I worked at Lowe’s for a time. While there, I bought a game on steam that taught Python. Overnight, I fell in love with coding. I took a year and taught myself how to code in Python through learnpython.org. I also gave myself the framework of making a fully-Python-based game engine (which I still haven’t finished), so that I could learn how the language worked. Now I’m back at the university learning coding. I took the required course on C++ and also researched ahead on some C++ concepts before they were taught, such as C++ classes and templating. Now I have practiced with C++ for over a year and am working on my own language. So all that to say we each have different roads and different ways of navigating through life.If you think you’re an imposter, you don’t have as much of a right to feel that way as I do, since I’m so late to the game and my life has more twists and turns than yours has. And I don’t feel that, because I’d rather give myself purpose and structure than to feel like I’m useless.

o4sh4bk,"""Refactoring"" isn't a magical tool that'll fix bad code - I honestly don't get why it is being taught like that, or even why someone would think that.Refactoring is simply a set of tools that you can use to more or less automatically restructure your code, if you want it to be written in a different way, like if you have one big function you want to split up in multiple different ones, if you want to rename variables, or change the input-parameters of a function across all uses. That is what refactoring is - it isn't something you can wave around that solves your weird memory-allocation scheme into something more professional.Anyways - first you plan how the code should be structured, you probably need to diagram something for this, as you won't be able to remember. You plan which classes you need, and which methods they should contain, what those methods should receive and return, and so on. You decide if some methods should perhaps be closer together in a single class, to keep coherence high, and you decide if some should receive fewer data-structures (or objects) to keep coupling loose ...Also, you make sure that you have valid tests that can run for both the un-refactored and the refactored code - if not, you write them along the way.Also, create a new branch for all this work, as you'll without a doubt break something!Then you begin - usually the steps are somewhat like this, but there's never a perfect recipe:1. Split functions and methods up into smaller parts2. Create additional classes and connect them3. Move functions / methods to their new classes4. Change globally available variables to locally where needed5. Change method parameters and/or return values - perhaps introduce new objects to be received and returned.Between each step you test, and once the tests pass, you commit - then go on to the next step.That is basically the way. Refactoring *never* makes the code ""better"" or ""faster"" from the computer's point of view - it is usually still the exact same lines of code that runs, but they are structured better from the programmers' point of view, so that they'll have an easier time implementing new features and changing functionality!",peterlinddk,2026-02-11 12:49:27,3,learnprogramming,t3_1r1uk7i,False,

Yeah, your existing code is shit, it's even got bugs, but it's a known quantity. What you're suggesting is all new code, that accomplishes the same goals as the old code, and it's unproven.

We HATE loss, so we're susceptible to things like the sunk cost fallacy. So to save some of the cost you've put into this code base, to minimize your losses, you try to make a minimal change. It's usually not robust enough to be a total solution, it's a hack or bandaid. One or two can be forgivable, but they add up quickly.> But yea anyone got any Advice for dealing with these Huge Tasks of either Refactoring or Rewriting Large Chunks of your Code >.>Third, this is the difference between juniors and seniors. I have 37 years of mistakes to inform my design decisions without having to consciously think about it - that's called intuition. This may be new code, but I've already made up my mind about it 20 years ago, when I had to learn that one thing the hard way... So refactoring is so hard because your system is too tightly coupled and does not tolerate refactoring. All software systems have their limitations, nothing is infinitely extensible or refactorable or perfectly decoupled. The difference is how far you can go before it starts looking like bandaids or hits the hard wall that you need a redesign.One form of refactoring is short-sighted, where what you have is ""over-fit"" (borrowing from my data analyst wife), too tightly coupled, not flexible or extensible, it only does exactly what it was designed to do, and how. So what you end up doing is redesigning the thing with YET ANOTHER over-fit solution.Another form of refactoring is well seasoned. You design with flexibility in mind. This can be a hard sell even in the industry, because it can seem pointless at the time if the others think this is a well understood and fixed area. So good code is actually needlessly decoupled, because you end up tripping over it eventually, and you'll be glad you have that flexibility built in. It's stupid until you end up needing it. It's extra and unnecessary complexity until you end up needing it. It's needlessly expensive (premature optimization) until you both need it and discover the performance didn't matter here, anyway.And that's a dangerous one - performance, people will die on that hill, but then you become over-dependent on the performance of that segment to makeup for the failings of other, ""justified"", sloppy and expensive code. Well now you have to break this thing, and you lose the performance, and it's not itself a big deal, but it does expose the weaknesses of other code. And rather than fixing it, there's more bias to ignore it and blame other parts, put the burden on them to make up for it.---Continued...",mredding,2026-02-11 15:50:58,1,learnprogramming,t3_1r1uk7i,False,

It means multiple tasks are literally running at the same time on different hardware resources.So yes, parallelism is usually considered a subset of concurrency. A concurrent program may or may not run in parallel depending on the hardware and runtime. But a parallel program is inherently concurrent because multiple flows of control exist at once.You’re also right that race conditions and deadlocks show up in both cases. They are properties of shared state and coordination, not of whether the CPU is single core or multi core. Even with context switching on one core, the interleaving can expose the same hazards.One mental model that helps is: concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.

(Every polynomial has a root in the field, and thus splits.)When you go from the Complex to the Quaternions, you lose commutativity (so xy ≠ yx for all x, y).When you go from the Quaternions to the Octonions, you lose associativity (so x(yz) ≠ (xy)z for all x, y, z, but you still have alternativity, which is a weaker form where (xx)y = x(xy) and y(xx) = (yx)x for all x, y.)The Sedenions are where the shit really hits the fan: you only have power associativity and you get nonzero divisors, i.e. ab = 0 where a ≠ 0 and b ≠ 0.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Dickson\_construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Dickson_construction)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Tbf-d9sE4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Tbf-d9sE4)**Instead: Factoradics**So you know how normally, we write numbers in base 10, e.g. 1234?And then we can write them in hexadecimal and binary?1234 in hex is 0x4d2 and in binary it's 0b10011010010?Well, another representation of numbers is called factoradic and is based on factorials. The rightmost digit is always 0, and the number is written: a_n * n! + a_{n-1} * (n-1)! + ... + a_1 * 1! + 0 * 0!where `0 ≤ a_i ≤ i` .Then 1234 in factoradic is: 1411200_! = 1 * 6! + 4 * 5! + 1 * 4! + 1 * 3! + 2 * 2! + 0 * 1! + 0 * 0! = 720 + 480 + 24 + 6 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 1234 (as expected in base-10)Here's my factoradic encoder / decoder and the explanation. Note that I prefer to use functional programming constructs when possible: hence why there are no loops here (tail call optimized recursion is my looping: in Kotlin, when you use the keyword val, you cannot reassign to a variable): hence why you see the `aux` function in encode. I (distastefully) use a MutableList all the same to avoid unnecessary list copies.I can't seem to paste it here (too long?) so I made a link to it:[https://www.codebin.cc/code/cmllwos8a0001jp03ugeek04n:Baiu3weZiEvY5UJgeBhDwP3X9HThZJDag3BTmUgDsrtS](https://www.codebin.cc/code/cmllwos8a0001jp03ugeek04n:Baiu3weZiEvY5UJgeBhDwP3X9HThZJDag3BTmUgDsrtS)Released under the 3-Clause BSD License, but not of much use to you unless you implement your own Factorial implementation (and there's a reasonable bit of machinery there as I represent a few dozen integer sequences and arrays).Right now I just finished polynomial rings / semirings and am working on quotient rings / semirings / fields so I can get the full gamut of finite fields for combinatorial constructions, elliptic curve cryptography (and other forms), coding theory, linear feedback shift registers, etc, as well as implementing geometric lattices nicely and naturally using rings like ℤ\[x\]/(x\^2 + x + 1) for the Eisenstein integers instead of jumping through hoops to replace ω\^2 = -ω - 1.(Not a beginner: I started programming when I was five and I'm 48 now and work in space astronomy.

C and C++ might go both ways.Side note: interpretation vs. compilation is not a property of the language but rather its implementation.

C is a high-level language in many contexts.

o50gsix,"Generally, high vs low level, and interpreted vs compiled are 2 completely different aspects of a programming language. The definition of high and low level languages has shifted over the years as we have developed more and more languages. But strictly speaking, a high level language is any language that abstracts away any specific hardware details. This means that pretty much every programming language falls into the category of “high level”, with the exceptions of assembly and machine code “languages” (if you could call machine code a language). This means that even languages like C, are considered a high level language. This is because when you write C, you do not need to consider the specific characteristics of the hardware your code will be running on. As long as a compiler exists for a target system, your C code will run largely the same on any system (assuming whatever libraries you use are similarly supported). I would say that your professor is largely correct, using this historical definition of high and low level language. However I would add the asterisk that some projects, most notably Linux, have plenty of source code written by humans in assembly. In this case, the assembly is still source code, but is still a low level language since it is dependent on the hardware it will run on. (In large projects like Linux, this often looks like writing the same functionality multiple times in assembly for each target hardware system. So while C code largely only has to be written once, you may find multiple implementations of the same functionality in multiple assembly languages)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_languageHowever, this distinction has somewhat shifted over the years and people some times use more relative terms like “high*er*” and “low*er*” level programming languages. These refer to how close or far to the hardware your language is abstracted away. So this means that while C is technically a high level language, it is often perceived as “low*er*” level than something like python. You’ll even see some people say that C is generally a “low*er*” level language. However these distinctions are largely semantic and don’t have much real meaning, especially when you’re first learning. I would not get caught up on these.The difference however between an interpreted and compiled language is completely different, and also in the modern day, much more complex. Generally speaking, an interpreter is any program that takes as an input some source code, and executes it without first compiling it to machine code. (Ripped from the first line on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing))) A compiler is then any program that takes source code in one language as an input, and outputs code in another language. However, almost always, this looks like translating a higher level language, into a lower level language, typically from a strictly high level language, into a strictly low level language (like C -> assembly).So the 2 concepts are somewhat related, but there is no exact relationship between them. Modern compilers and interpreters are much more complex and have many stages that translate source code through many different levels of abstraction. And, modern programming languages have started blurring the lines between what is seen as higher level and lower level.",gman1230321,2026-02-12 17:16:25,1,learnprogramming,t3_1r2ycob,False,
o50sef1,"Low level languages are coupled to the machine, it's architecture, it's instruction set, and are often inseparable and non-portable.Machine code itself is low level - almost as low as you can go, just short of micro-code and physical wiring.Assembly is higher level, including symbols, directives, macros, constants, comments... but by definition its statements correspond 1:1 with machine code instructions. You might write a `mov` statement, but which specific instruction you get is dependent on it's parameters.High level languages target abstract machines and are portable. C++, for example, targets an abstract, byte addressable stack machine, two's compliment signed integers, little-endian, etc. So byte offset and bit manipulation on up - calling conventions, etc, all that is beyond the language, and must be defined by the implementation. So if your machine is word-addressable, the compiler has to translate byte addressing into words in some way.Languages can affect architecture; C++03 is THE DEFINITION of the x64 Itanium ABI, and is standard for the hardware, which was designed around it. That doesn't some how lower the level of the language on that particular platform.So it doesn't matter if the language is compiled or interpreted.

o5whdhf,"This is why I often say programming is easy, at least at this level. The real challenge is taking a specification (word problem) and turning it into code.One thing I can suggest is to take everyday tasks, that a person knows well, and turn them into a word problem and then turn that into code. It might be as something as simple as checking the mail. That might sound simple at first but you generally have to open a door or two, walk to the mail box, open the mail box, grab the mail and return. The more one thinks seriously about what appears to be a simple task, the faster one realizes how detailed one needs to be to get software to do the job. Creating the pseudo code becomes a challenge of iteratively walking through the code until you can actually get the mail. The interesting thing about checking the mail word problem, is that you can check your work by physically walking through your pseudo code.In any event there are lots of things in real life that can help you understand the conversion of tasks into code. The more ""everyday"" the task the more impressive the complexity of what a person does everyday not thinking about it. Brush your teeth in the morning and start to think about how all those actions would be expressed in code. Would the stroking back and forth, be a function to simplify your code.As for the OP I have to point out that this is an extremely common issue. That is turning written requirements into code and frankly it often has nothing to do with programming. However it is absolutely critical to becoming a good programmer. In the real world many times your specification might not be well defined causing one to do some research. That might mean reading a manual to get a device into a mode that you wan work with. The point is your word problems become outlines leaving out critical information you need to fill in. In other words in school you are lucky in that the word problems are generally complete, sometimes you need to figure out what a department really wants.",spinwizard69,2026-02-17 17:50:24,1,learnprogramming,t1_o5t2yst,False,

o5btqdx,"I'll list some things that might make you consider using message brokers, not in order of importance and not in a mumbo jumbo scientific way.1. A message broker is a separate, usually unchanging serviceThis means that redeploying your service has no effect on receiving data and storing event data. You could argue that writing events to a database is the same - and you'd be right, however we're not done yet! 2. Let's take a topic exchange as an example, you've created your topic exchange and have many routing keys for it. One of these routing keys is lets say for messages indicating that a payment has been completed.One day, you'd like to send these payments to a fraud detection company (totally random example, I'm still having coffee), you could make the most barebones service that simply registers a new queue/binding to this exchange listening to the same routing key your main service already listens - and you'll receive a copy of all the payment events.This plug and play style once your messaging system is set up is really comfortable and doesn't require extra work apart from occasionally adding a new field to your message.3. Manual acknowledgement + outbox/inbox patterns for your messages/events is intuitive and safe to work with . Retries are handled with minimal work from your side with the correct configuration for your queue - connectivity issues and the like can be glossed over and you can define a threshold for dead letters where you'll actually have to think if messages reach there - but little connectivity issues or temporary outages don't really hurt you. 4. It's super easy to scale! Apart from being able to plug different consumers into the same routing key to get copies of messages to do different things with them you can also plug multiple (usually identical) instances of a consumer to a single queue so they can fairly share the work. It's really simply to dynamically scale this by adding or removing consumers to a queue that isn't doing the work fast enough.4.5-ish. Like you already mentioned and as it might be a bit obvious it really helps keep your system tidy(er) where each instance can just do its own thing and if you need something *else* you just make something fresh and connect it without bogging down your existing services with more responsibilities. Obviously it's not all sunshine and rainbows and you can easily make a sprawling mess of events flying all over the place and eventual consistency does have its own considerations.",disposepriority,2026-02-14 12:09:58,4,learnprogramming,t3_1r4iu1u,False,

If the API actually also does stuff (goes to the kitchen and makes the stuff requested), it stops being interactive for that duration, which is its primary job. So the API delegates as much work as possible to keep being interactive, the work is done via queues and message brokers.In short, any (real) work should not be done by the API, it should get done by something else.

Like imagine there are multiple instances of your application each with their own local in memory queue, a message might be sent to both and the work is duplicated or some consistency criteria might even break. You can have this sync without queues but if you need queues anyways, just using a service for queues that can observe all the events is massively helpful.4) the queue can scale independently 5) observability, you have once central logical place where the queues report to even if internally they are all running in different physical/virtual systems.

For “metrics,” people often use it to avoid coupling request latency to logging/storage and to survive DB outages without dropping events.

o4v8jwg,"I'm not entirely sure what I should picture under ""robot sumo competition"" but I have a bit of experience in foundational robotics in my CS degree.To answer your questions: Yes, you can use a camera and a bunch of methods to recognize things. OpenCV is a widespread standard image processing library. You can do C++ but I honestly would say the adapter to Python would probably be a bit more easier to handle because you can use Python for ML stuff as well if you want to, even if Python isn't exactly the fastest.One of the problem you really need to figure out first is to determine the boundary of the problem. What do you mean when you say ""front"" and ""back"" of a robot?If the competition has defined features of a robot, you can use that to determine what constitutes front and back. Using standard or advanced image processing algorithms are going to be an option in this case.A very straight-forward case would be if the competition requires every robot to show some sort of marker for the front facing side. You can use some variant of HOG (histogram of oriented gradients) or if its more complicated SIFT (Scale-invariant feature transform) to get a decently robust feature detection for the front-side and then deduct that the absence of that feature plus something else like rotational tracking will be the back-side.You can also try the Generalized Hough Transform (although that one might be a bit too slow for pictures with too many pixels).All 3 algorithms are implemented in OpenCV I think (although if not, you can certainly just build them yourself using the OpenCV toolkit).But If robots can look arbitrary and you cannot say that there is some sort of fixed recognizable features, the detection is going to be tricky and OpenCV will not solve your problem. In the latter case, I would honestly consider resorting to machine learning. Retraining CNNs for classification can yield pretty decent results. You would need to have a decently sized training set of images of competition robots fronts and back. You would then do the pre-processing in OpenCV and then pass it on to the model or if you have something integrated like from Nvidia's developer suite, maybe use their stuff.The problem with the ML approach is that you need a decently powerful compute platform on your robot. Even if the majority of computation happens at training phase, processing and then prediction still takes decent amount of compute power. Small embedded systems with a good GPU to handle matrix operations are necessary while not being power hungry monsters.Your other question is a bit vague: What do you mean ""friend or foe system"" for ""recognizing yourself""?",theusualguy512,2026-02-11 21:00:06,2,learnprogramming,t3_1r273ye,False,
o4w9e90,"Yes, this is definitely doable, especially with an overhead camera where you control the environment. The simplest way to detect front and back is to add asymmetric markers to each robot, like a colored patch on one end or distinct shapes, so orientation can be inferred from the contour or marker positions. For friend or foe, you can give your robot a unique color pattern or fiducial marker and track that specifically, which avoids relying on pure shape detection.Since you are new to CV, I would start with basic color thresholding and contour detection in OpenCV before jumping into anything fancy. Real time performance in C++ should be fine if your frame size and processing pipeline stay reasonable.

The difference is that some people have been struggling for 3–5 years already, so it looks effortless now.The fact that you’re building your own projects while learning GitHub and Java is actually a strong sign. That’s exactly how you improve.A few practical tips that helped me:1.Stop comparing progress. Compare consistency. Are you coding weekly? That’s what matters.2.Focus on one path at a time. Git + Java + side projects is good, but don’t constantly switch directions.3.Build tiny projects you can finish in a few days.

o5thu8j,"I am a staff eng with 11yoe. 2 at FAANG and one at a full remote startup (because I wanted to work out of country for a while). My first job out of college was a TC of around 160. My current role had a new offer of around 600 and with current stock appreciation, it’s around 850. I’m going to tell you exactly the 3 metrics needed for high TC. Note that I mentioned 600 new offer and 850 with stock appreciation. The 850 is luck, basically being lucky with the right company. The 600 is what really matters, because when you look at levels.fyi, you need to filter by “new offers only” to get an accurate calibration. You might join Nvidia with a TC of 300 working with someone at the same level that has 5x your TC. Don’t be upset about this. 1) Being good - this is the baseline. You have to be in the top 10-20% of engineers on the market. There are a million resources on this but I’ll give you 2 piece of advice. A) An engineer is there to solve business problems and generate revenue using code as a tool. Do not rely only on technical skills. B) Learn and respect the other business units. For the 5+ years I’ve been on this sub, I see stuff every month like “what do PMs do all day” or “recruiting is so easy lol just lay them off”. Not saying you did this, I’m saying that in general, engineers have this unwarranted sense of superiority. There is always something to learn from everyone that can help your career progression 2) Revenue/employee - or if you want to get pedantic, it’s more like profit/employee. Think about an unsexy company like Craigslist. They make around $300-$600m/yr but with 50 employees. Or something like Valve which is $16b-$17b/yr with 350 employees. These companies don’t get mentioned here, but the employees working there are probably making tons more than me at a FAANG or employees in the new wave of AI frontier labs.3) Location - at my company, we have geographical multipliers on our base salary and stocks. For example, (I’m just making numbers up) let’s say I get $1m vested over 4 years. Bay Area and NYC get a multiplier of 1.0 so I get the full $1m. Someone in Hyderabad or Tel Aviv for example might have a multiplier of 0.4-0.6. Is this unfair? Yes, but this is just the way the world and macro economics work. Why does it cost me $19 for a bowl of pho when I can get a better one in Hanoi for $1.35? Same reason why you are not making as much as you could be if you were to move to Bay / NYC or stop looking for remote roles4) Everything else that doesn’t really matter as much.

And here's the truth: people don't have even have the slightest clue of what they're talking about.Originally I studied Finance and Accounting. My first job was at a Big 4 public accounting firm in 2016, they demoed an AI agent that could do our job to show they were ""cutting edge."" Did we use it? No. We used excel workbooks that have been around longer than your grandma's fridge. Did we leverage Python, VBA, and so on to work better and faster like I knew how to do? No. Some of these people could barely move around a single sheet in Excel.Then I worked at a F500 company. In addition to regular accounting and finance work, tried as much as possible to automate. I tried to do things better, faster, more efficiently. I wrote ""shadow apps"" (not managed by the dev teams) for other financial analysts and accountants as the massive dev teams we had didn't have ""capacity"". Eventually I hit a wall and essentially there was so much I wanted to incorporate and change but was denied the tools needed to deploy and maintain them. Basically ""sorry you're not an SWE so we can't give you access."" So I left and now I'm building financial systems and doing meaningful work as a SWE and getting my masters in CS. And making more than I did before and happier.Here's my takeaway: you will be stunned to see how SLOW companies adopt tech outside of big tech companies. Even if you TRY you'll hit resistance.If you have a desire to build a solution, you will have a job. If people on this sub or the vibe coding subs think an accountant at a F500 company will use Claude Code to vibe up a solution, I'm sorry but it will not happen about 90% of the time. If they didn't write basic Python scripts before, they are not vibe coding now. Anyone that believes that will happen are either delusional or have never actually worked outside of tech roles.And a final note: I could have automated 80% of my work as an accountant and financial analyst pre-AI.

If a company wants to be somewhere, they'll lease property. If a company doesn't want or need to be somewhere, they'll let leases expire. And then everything else falls into line with the leases.10 years ago, every smart CFO advocated very long leases to reduce lease rates. Now that companies have been shown that they don't need people onsite, every smart CFO is recommending that the company only renew very essential leases and let the rest expire. This is a corporate finance tectonic shift on par with switching to defined-contribution retirement plans (late '90's) and switching to unlimited PTO (late '00's).If you like working there, make yourself as valuable as you can. It still might not make the difference, but it usually does. If your boss can say about you to their boss ""I can't succeed without this person"", then you are usually safe. That's your goal...if you want to stay there.And in a few years when your company's leases expire, then leadership will say that they've discovered or realized that WFH is a vital part of work life balance or whatever stupid way they have of justifying what is ultimately a financial, lease-centric decision.",jimmy-buffett,2026-02-11 23:18:55,16,cscareerquestions,t3_1r2aupk,False,

o5iii4y,"I think some variation of this is what often gets overlooked. Let's just say that AI, across the board, makes all software dev take 25% the human time that it used to. On the surface that means 75% of devs get laid off. But in reality, this ignores the factor of human ambition and greed. The ultimate goal of a company isn't to punch off its current TODO list. It's to maximize profits. So at least some of those 75% should end up building new features and launching new products to generate more profits through efforts that wouldn't have been justifiable at the previous cost of development.And some of them will go off and start their own companies doing things with a person or two that previously would have taken a team, startup capital, etc.And so on.I think the same thing applies to the idea of people sitting idle overall. If you look at all of the laid off people coldly as a resource pool sitting idle waiting to be exploited to generate profits, it starts to look as silly to not find a way to put them to work as it would be to not tap into an oil well sitting idle in your backyard. Not because you're trying to do a good deed by giving them a job, but because you're trying to make more money. Which is really the only reason anyone has a job today.The truly difficult part could be the relative pace of all of this - if millions of people get laid off at an unprecedented rate, it will take time to figure out how to leverage this new human resource - what happens in that time? But in the long run, I suspect that the ultimate answer to how we keep ourselves busy in the face of these new tools will be the same answer that has accompanied every productivity increasing technological development in human history: we'll just do more.

Just hire less people and cut down on time to train them as that’s lost revenue, and also lay off employees who are not absolutely essential or senior level people because they obviously just do nothing right? Makes their labor cost go down, shareholders see better numbers in the immediate, everything is smooth sailing until it’s not.2. The senior level people that stay on assume the work of their peers that got laid off, get a slight pay bump (or none sometimes) to do their work being “augmented” by ai, this basically allows the company to get more labor for paying the same price effectively.Dollar now > dollar tomorrowEveryone loses, they win, economy gets wrecked we lose jobs, they get record profits and re invest into other business ventures or just pay themselves with the “returns” :grinning_face_with_big_eyes:",crustyDryTowel,2026-02-15 14:38:28,10,cscareerquestions,t3_1r5frgy,False,

It will take a lot to overcome so much global change. I enjoy programming and solving complex logic problems so that's the reason I am in the field still.

Something in your application materials is triggering an automatic rejection before human eyes ever see them. The fact that your network connections got you interviews proves you can perform when given the chance, so the barrier is purely at the screening stage.Six resume rewrites might actually be hurting you if each version strays further from ATS optimization. Consider this: get your most recent version reviewed by someone currently hiring in tech, not just resume writers. They’ll spot what’s causing the auto-rejections. Also, gaps on your resume or the layoff itself might need different framing. Some companies filter out anyone currently unemployed, which is brutal but realYour tech stack isn’t the problem since those skills are still in demand. More likely it’s resume formatting breaking ATS parsers, missing keywords that match job descriptions exactly, or your experience level falling into an awkward middle zone where you’re overqualified for junior roles but competing with seniors.Stop applying to undervalued positions immediately. That signals desperation and companies assume you’ll leave when something better appears. Focus on contract or freelance work to fill the gap while maintaining your search.

I can only speak to my own experience, but I'm a mostly self taught SWE who switched from a completely unrelated field and have managed to do pretty well for myself at this point, but the thing that made my career growth possible was that I spent the first 4 years of my software career at a tiny startup that just wanted hard workers willing to learn.

So if you ask on experienced devs, you'll probably get a lot of people who are saying language doesn't matter and what not, but the good ones will say the opportunity is only good if you are willing to make the leap to learn the other language.Java is one of those languages that can feel ""old fashioned"" by todays standards because of the fact so many other languages figured out shortcuts or answers to common problems that still exist in java. So my conclusion has been it always is universally painful when anyone is trying to traverse going from something like dotnet or python to a java system. I'm living that pain right now and I'm primarily a dotnet dev that got hired into a java shop that needed a dotnet dev for a side project. And you are right Java Spring is full on magic box because people have built answers to so many problems. It's less programming and more like fitting together pieces of a puzzle, which is why I kind of dislike it.

Then they flew people who did well on the interview to California for a long weekend, with the first day giving presentations on different departments in the company, then after lunch a 4 hour programming test. The next day there were interviews in the morning. Early afternoon they met with people one on one and gave some of us a job offer, put some people on a maybe list, and gave others no offer. Then an optional group activity in the afternoon, a nice dinner with the people who got offers.

The Dilbert strip stereotype of managers having no technical skills was very true. Because many businesses that previously had been ran without computers had migrated to being software based. So the people with domain experience, who were now in management, had not started their careers in a software based world. The whole CS domain felt a lot simpler back then. I only needed to know C++, a little MFC, and some SQL basics. Maybe a more senior person would be good with COM.

I am slightly surprised you can get a senior job without ever working. My worry would be - how do you work in a team, are you familiar with code reviews, shared code bases with git, writing architecture documents, clarifying requirements etc. Especially in senior role you get a lot more responsibilities that are not just code, but you need to be able to drive architecture and communicate to management effectively, steering them in the right direction.Regarding questions and what you put into your cv, full stack vs backend - it doesn’t matter. They will hire based on what they need for the role. If the role leaning to front end they will ask more about frontend. The cv won’t change that. So just keep your cv truthful. There’s a lot of backend leaning full stack positions and you fit that, don’t apply to front end leaning positions.Blazor is definitely used and I do see some positions for it.

Your 8 years of keeping a production app running is honestly more valuable than most people realize bc that shows you understand the full lifecycle, can handle real user problems, and know how to maintain code over time. The fact that you've dealt with race conditions, auth systems, and layered architecture tells me you're not just copying tutorials.For the interview prep, I'd brush up on basic SQL optimization, maybe review some common C# patterns, and be ready to walk through your architecture decisions on your main project. They'll probably ask you to solve a simple coding problem, but it's more likely to be ""write a method that does X"" rather than dynamic programming puzzles. As for the full stack vs backend question, honestly your Blazor experience might be more of an asset than you think as lots of .NET shops are curious about it but don't have anyone who actually knows it well. I wouldn't pivot away from mentioning it, especially since it shows you can handle the whole stack when needed. Small companies love that versatility because they don't have huge teams.

CTEs are worth learning though since they make complex queries much more readable and interviewers appreciate clean code. One tip for practice: try converting everyday questions into SQL queries.

Try to get any tech job during your break between school.Something you can try is look for full time jobs in your area. When you see the posting, try to contact through the careers area of the website, email, or if you have to, through the application itself.However you are able to try to contact someone, let them know you are an older student who will be graduating in two years, you are checking out different careers, this one caught your eye, and you are wondering what the career is like, what courses might help, and any advice anyone who will talk to you has.Ask for a phone call, email, or buy them a cup of coffee or lunch. Get the advice and just listen, don't ""but what about, or I heard, or people say"", just listen and ask actually meaningful questions. Right after, and I mean right after, write everything down, whatever you can remember.This is both local advice, networking, and a sort of introduction to an interview.Keep doing this as you can. Keep your eye out for and ask about any local events where IT people meet to talk IT stuff, if you can, try to attend. The goal is to be seen.Getting the degree and being a good fit for the company and the team are what is important. Regardless of what you take, you are not going to really know what you are doing for the first five years, so when people give you free advice, listen.Ideally, you will graduate having had a few tech summer jobs, and have networked with several people.

o54sxt7,">The main thing that bothers me about OMSCS is the time commitment with how bad the job market is. I've seen several people who still can't get a job even after doing OMSCS which really makes me question if it's worth it.OMSCS is not going to move the needle in terms of recruiting, most recruiters are aware of the program and its 90% acceptance rate after they've seen thousands of applications of people blasting through Georgia Tech MSCS (online omitted of course). Everytime I say this I get someone pointing out the rigor, which I don't find to be a working argument because any decent engineering program is going to be fairly rigorous in its own right. What recruiters actually care about is name brand and the selectivity signal that comes with prestige. Example in point: a majority of interns are completely useless and are a complete net loss for the company. Having a nice internship from a good big tech is still going to move the needle very favorably resume-wise because of the bar of what it took to be accepted, and the signal to recruiters that you were able to get in a prestigious company, even if you didn't really do anything productive.>I've heard several people say they completely blacklist WGU grads so that's why I'm concerned with just having it on my resume.No one is specifically blacklisting WGU, this seems very unlikely. The simpler and more likely reason at hand is that your resume is probably not competitive enough for the current landscape. Adding OMSCS to your resume is not going to change that either.The reality is that it's going to be very difficult for average CS grads to find work within this environment and landscape. The easier times when many people could reasonably make their way into a decent SWE job have passed, and is most likely not going to come back. SWE payroll has always been one of the biggest costs that companies look to reduce within their financials, and rampant outsourcing and AI have done a lot to cut down on available jobs.",lime_midget,2026-02-13 08:44:59,10,cscareerquestions,t3_1r3gpaw,False,

If I know I didn't have a good explanation of a detail on my resume, I can brainstorm a few and practice them until they sound natural. Or if I flubbed a coding section, practice it. Look up the questions I didn't know.I guess you can try to read between the lines of the little feedback you did get too. Like if your profile was impressive, they might have thought your performance didn't match their expectations (for that experience or title before).Or ask for very broad suggestions on places to improve. It could be near the end of the interview itself, before the decisions. Maybe even offering ideas yourself to make it easy for them to parrot it back if you're worried about bothering them. And to show where you think you could best improve.Maybe I've just gotten enough experience finally, but ""culture fit"" (and confidence) has felt really important for a lot of my previous interviews. Do you fit in. Are you like us. Can I work with you, and do I want to. Information can be learned. New tools often are like other tools (new dialect). Is your first instinct like mine (different means unique solutions, same means they'd agree with it).Or they need a Kung Fu master to come in and be the expert/owner.

I don’t know if HR sends generic rejections or just ghosts you if we reject.Phone round - I stopped doing this because i felt it’s pretty useless, it was useful screening tool when we didn’t do virtual interviews and instead had in person interviews. Generally I go over work experience, poke around some technical areas, see if you know what you’re talking about or if the resume was exaggerated. Also good opportunity for both parties to calibrate expectations, so we aren’t wasting eachother’s time. Then wrap up with LC easy question, my go to is a graph search algorithm.Onsite/Virtual final round - now this highly depends on the role. For IC I usually do system design round, for other EMs, I’ve done system design and roadmap planning and strategic vision. Main reason I’ve failed people who solved the system design was due to lack of depth in understanding. It’s very clear when they’re regurgitating from a video they’ve seen rather than make live trade off decisions and ask clarifying questions. Did I really say speed was necessary? Or do we care about accuracy and freshness of data? Why are you adding a cache? Did you clarify the DAU and types of requests to be confident in your cache hit rate? You get the picture. For EM side, it’s usually their examples from their previous job lacks the scope we were looking for. “How did you drive alignment across the organization? How many teams were involved? Did you come up with a proposal for leadership? How much coordination tax would this take? What is the risk if we don’t complete?”TL;DR - we’re human, your interviewer needs to like you and you need to fit their similarity bias.

First was Graduate Algorithms. It used to be homework plus exams, but they switched it to basically exam-only for grading. From what I heard, that change happened after one semester where the professor/TAs flagged a bunch of students to the Office of Student Integrity, and most of them ended up winning their cases. After that, they moved to exams only.Second was AI course. They rolled out a VS Code based IDE called NOSI that tracks all of your activity. And in that class, you’re not allowed to use AI at all, or even the internet. You’re expected to rely strictly on the textbook, lectures, and write your code in that IDE. It also got two take-home exams that are like 50 pages each, and you get a week for each one, also no internet allowed.Third was Machine Learning. This one is the complete opposite, you can use as much AI as you want, even to generate all of your code. But the class is so hard that even with AI, it still took me like 20–30 hours a week (so they basically made the course almost impossible to get through without using AI). On top of that there’s also an Honorlock-proctored exam.So yeah, just from these 3 classes alone, it’s basically three totally different approaches to dealing with AI tools.",Sad-Sympathy-2804,2026-02-11 06:51:34,20,cscareerquestions,t3_1r1pxr5,False,

o5sjhfp,"i think there's a few issues here: 1. i could be wrong, but this seems like you're going over a page. generally for new grad, you should fit everything into a page.2. the projects you are showcasing are all class projects (i'm assuming). if a recruiter is looking through resumes from your school and see the same X projects every single time, your resume doesn't stand out. why pick you over one of the other applicants in the pool? i also think it helps to have your own projects, because it shows how you can solve a problem of your own. recruiters and hiring managers like to see people who take initiative. 3. since your projects are all class projects, it's very hard to describe impact. this isn't to say that you can't use class projects at all, but you better have metrics or it needs to have been extended in some way. recruiters want to see numbers - how many users did your project get? or if not user facing, how much were you able to optimize the performance and how much data could your project handle?4. if you are graduating, your education should be at the top. additionally, your skills section is a mess - for example, ""SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MongoDB)"" is a major red flag to me, given that mongoDB is not in fact a SQL-based database. you need to focus your skill section as well - ""Data Structures & Algorithms, Sorting, Tree Traversals"" - these are not skills that are particularly relevant. i'd highly recommend going through a bunch of job postings and taking a look at what skills they're looking for and condense. even senior engineers don't have a skill section as massive as yours. ""DevOps, Access Controls (RBAC, DAC, MAC, ABAC), Cloud Computing, Machine Learning / AI implementation, SaaS, Encryption / Decryption and Security, Concurrency, Distributed Systems"" - very hard for a recruiter or interviewer to believe that you have all these skills as a new grad without any work experience. and just speaking a bit from personal experience, as someone who's scanned a few resumes and interviewed people: candidates who list this many skills on their resume tend to not do that well during interviews. if my team was passed a resume like this, i (and my colleagues) would likely pass on you.5. i know you don't have much relevant work experience, but you can frame extracurriculars as experience as well (so long as they're tech related in some way)",LsForDays,2026-02-17 01:51:47,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1r6sdkf,False,

The imposter syndrome is real, but tbh I think you're overthinking this.Here's the thing about those foundational gaps you mentioned. Yeah, they're important for certain roles, but for the path you're describing (backend dev, cloud infrastructure, applied ML), you can absolutely fill those gaps without going back to school. I've been learning this stuff in real time while building, and honestly some of the best engineers I know are self-taught or have non-CS degrees.The AI systems architect goal is totally doable without a formal CS degree. What matters more is understanding how to design scalable systems, knowing your way around cloud platforms, and having practical experience with ML workflows. I'm seeing this firsthand - we're building Sprout (an AI job search tool) and the technical challenges are more about system design, data pipelines, and user experience than theoretical CS concepts. The foundational stuff comes up, but you learn it when you need it.That said, if you do want structured learning, there are way more efficient options than a full degree program. MIT OpenCourseWare has excellent systems courses, Coursera has solid ML specializations, and honestly YouTube + building projects will teach you more practical skills than most university programs. The Georgia Tech OMSCS program is solid if you really want the credential later, but you could probably test into it with your existing experience and some strategic self-study.The real question is whether you need the degree for credibility or just the knowledge. For backend/cloud/systems architecture roles, your portfolio and ability to solve problems matters way more than your diploma.

Of course, i always make sure to double check what’s been implemented.Anyways, i came to realize that I don’t really encounter too much heavy math or really any of the foundational topics i mentioned in my post. Well, except maybe data structures and algorithms. But I know for a fact I can just revisit those topics on my own. Even then, the type of data structures and algorithms that I come across or use aren’t really all too complicated.I guess i’d like to pivot into something with a little more “job security”. I feel like ai systems management is the way to go. But, to be perfectly frank, i haven’t taken much of a deep dive with system design nor machine learning. Im just at that stage where I’m thinking about pivoting into those roles. Right now im doing mostly basic crud both fe and be. Which is why im wanting to do something that’s a little more future proof. That’s why im considering perhaps going back to school. To learn the fundamentals of cs. But, I honestly do feel that I can teach myself these things. The tricky thing is coming up with a solid structure/strategy. In fact, i asked chat gpt and it actually did lay out a pretty solid plan. Thank you for those course recommendations btw, ill make sure to look into those. Maybe it’s the confirmation bias talking (i really do try to look both sides of the equation), but your response has sort of helped put my mind at ease. Honestly, I’m fine with hearing both sides. I just like not keep all of this bottled up in my head as I tend to overthink. I generally go with my intuition, but, it’s still good to keep an open mind.
