There's simply so many more people with those skills today then there was 10-15 years ago.10-15 years ago, finding someone who could code was more difficult than today, so companies took whoever they could find and gave them a good salary to do a lot of tech work. As smart phones and social media and e-commerce were still relatively new and starting to boom, these companies were just getting off the ground and needed someone, anyone, who could code. Those folks wore many hats in their job.5 -7 years ago, as more people graduated college with CS degrees or did online bootcamps in hopes of getting these coding jobs, these companies found that they could be more selective in hiring. Okay, they found plenty of people who can code, but how many of them can code and interpret all this data we have? Thus the hiring direction narrows the scope of candidates.In the last 5 years, we again see so many people getting CS degrees, learning to code, bootcamps etc. that companies can again be even more selective in their hiring.

o2a1koq,"I prefer to build streaming first. It's not about the speed for me. First, it's about control and localizing failure. To use your examples; If I break up the CSV putting each row in it's own message, process each row one at a time, and one fails, that row fails, not the whole CSV. That way I know exactly where the problem is and my users have access to the data that is not wrong while the issue with the failures gets handled. Slapping a CDC implementation gives me a stream of all the changes to the relational database not just the end state when the incremental job ran. If the load drastically increases the streaming system gives me a buffer without having to scale my workers unless the load sustains past my data latency requirements. I've seen incremental jobs like that lock up a worker using all the memory because it was suddenly getting back much more from querying the relational database than it had been designed to handle. It couldn't process anything until those workers got scaled up.Second, I think you pointed out something with the fact that you're doing streaming on one system and batch on another. You now effectively have two different types of systems you're maintaining. If you go Kappa architecture as opposed to Lambda architecture you only have one type of system and that simplifies your operational overhead. Even if streaming is harder to operate, you end up ahead. I've never personally found a streaming system more operationally difficult but people do. If you're only going to have one kind of system, I think it's easier to put a batch of work on a streaming system than to try and micro-batch your way to approximating a streaming system.Lastly, and this is more personal, I like to think of data pipelines in a functional programming or even unix shell scripting model.

Warehouses and data lakes - Azure ADLS, Amazon S3, Redshift, etc.They all store data, but for different purposes. RDBMS systems are used for storing application data that gets read and updated by users all the time (think of user profiles, posts, comments to posts, orders, etc.), and these store data in relational row-based form under the hood, and have their own internal mechanisms for data processing related to application business logic, constraint and transaction enforcement (OLTP for application data).NoSQL systems also store application business data, they're preferred in the use cases where RDBMS' strict constraint, transaction, schema enforcement and strong consistency become a bottleneck - mainly, data partitioning. It's a big and complex topic to explain in one sentence, but generally speaking, NoSQL systems sacrifice those perks to some degree to achieve native and easy horizontal scalability across multiple servers in a cluster (don't confuse with read replicas), which is a tradeoff that's OK for many modern use cases.Warehouses and data lakes is where that application data later lands to from the main database(s), for the purposes of analytical workloads, BI, AI/ML (OLAP workloads). The reason data is placed in a different place for these workloads is because it needs to be organized differently under the hood to be efficiently queried for these purposes (keywords to look up - columnar data format, parquet, OLAP) - while application database needs to be fast for lots of small individual writes and reads per row, warehouses need to be very fast at batch querying, big scans and throughput. And Spark is a data processing tool, that does distributed processing for warehouses and data lakes, not for OLTP workloads.

Use EXPLAIN plans, avoid SELECT \*, think about index usage.\*\*2.

Real data engineering involves catching bad data before it breaks pipelines.\*\*3. Incremental processing\*\*: Since you mentioned building pipelines mostly in Python, practice SQL patterns for incremental loads - using timestamps, watermarks, and merge/upsert logic.

Practice writing queries that transform entire datasets at once rather than row-by-row logic.\*\*5. Real-world scenarios\*\*: Go beyond LeetCode. Practice queries like:\- Detecting duplicate orders\- Calculating running totals/moving averages \- Handling NULL values and edge cases\- Transforming nested/JSON dataFor Shopify specifically: They care about how you communicate your approach.

o2kvrao,">What's the motivation to still pursue this field ?As somebody who went into this field from a different field, if you work in IT/programming, don't suck at it, and work for a decent company, GOOD LORD is it a sweet deal.Life as a chemist:* There is no such thing as remote work. You are on-site 100% of the time. I used to have to commute 1.5 hours one way if it was a quick journey. Made me give up all of my hobbies post work. Standard working day was around 12 hours (wake up at 6, get home at around 6). Yeah, I could have moved closer but I'm glad I didn't because it meant I'd have moved to bum fuck nowhere for a job which ended my contract during the pandemic* Labs are often in shitty locations. Good luck if you want to live near a city and have a reasonable commute time. Didn't pack a lunch? Budget 20 minutes of your lunch time getting to and from somewhere to get something to eat* People think lab work is a refined art where people stand around in pristine labs and discuss how the universe works. In reality, the labs are freezing cold in winter, swelteringly hot in summer, and poorly maintained. Half of me isn't surprised because if there is an explosion/fire, it's not a huge amount of damage cost.* No windows can be quite common in buildings. Somewhere I used to work, during winter there were days I'd see no natural light (get in before sun rise, sun sets at around 4 pm)* It's also a lot more physical than people give credit for. Lifting large/heavy vessels into/out of your fume cupboard as well as transporting large quantities of materials isn't easy on your back as you get older* I worked in organic synthesis where if you don't have a PhD in chemistry, it's incredibly hard to not only break into the field but succeed because you're talking about the vast majority of people have a PhD, thus use it as a stick to beat you with (quite fairly, tbh). I do not have a PhD and was usually the only person in the lab who didn't have a PhD* The work environment is a lot less forgiving than tech. You can't google and hit the right answer easily. You really have to know what you are asking the internet. Even then, the answers are likely not widely published. People are a lot smarter on average and a lot less willing to accept bullshit answers* Salaries are not remotely comparable although you do get a much better pension. For reference, I used the chemical companies used to pretty much double your contributions. I have never seen that figure in ITLife as a DE:* Work from home is an option. If you have to turn up, at least your office is likely somewhere accessible and temperature controlled* A much lower barrier to entry. The idea you ""need"" a Masters degree is, in my opinion, complete bollocks. DE education requirements are not standardised across the industry whereas chemistry absolutely is. It's not possible to get into chemistry without a chemistry degree, although you can definitely get into data without a CS degree* Difficulty isn't anywhere near as close. If I ruin a reaction in the lab, good luck getting that shit back. I guess it's like dropping a DB without a back up, although it's much easier to back something up than it is to make an extra X amount of material in case, I don't know, you drop your flask on the floor, somebody knocks it over etc. You live in a world of glass so breakages are inevitable* General working is a lot easier. Synthesis of a product can take a long time. A long one is multiple days if not weeks. You can turn something around quickly and have almost unlimited tries at it in DE* Stakes being lower means it's not as stressful although it does mean you get a lot more bozos because people are less careful. The introduction of AI has massively exposed who is and isn't a fraud (anybody who struggles without AI or ""has to"" lie on their CV is absolutely a fraud)* Zero manual labour. Much much lower chances of dying - I used to make novel pharmaceutical compounds which were definitely biologically active although since it has never been made or tested before (publicly), nobody has any idea how toxic the compound is. So, it could either do nothing or murder you on the spot. Fun fact: I once made something which was over 30 times more potent than fentanyl* Salaries are way higher on average. After 2-3 years of being in DE, I earnt double what I did as my final salary as a chemist after around 10 years in the industrySo what I'm saying is life is relative. If you have only ever worked in tech, then yeah, the grass will always seem greener.

o1m7973,"So first answer:From pandas 2.0 onwards a lot of change was made to move from numpy into arrow, so you cant just use np.nans as pandas nans now, its pd.NA. Instead .replace operations you use assignement. Strings and datetime gets some changes as well as categorical types. Some changes with pd.read_excel as well. Slicing and a lot of your operations need to be explicit now instead of implicit. Whats going to bite you the most is numpy rather than pandas here.Second Answer:Use polars + pandas, especially once you get everything setup in arrow types, its a seamless transfer of the dfs; while working with my team I use polars for the heavy stuff like merges, concats and stuff. ANd pandas for anything that needs to be verbose and redeable, like mathemtical operations or column based functions. Polars sucks at the whole thing because their approach of map_elements is inconsistent and expects something everytime. Polars also breaks their apis and their intended behavior quite a lot.Just 1.0 to 3.0 from numpy to arrow should be about 4x boost in perf, polars + pandas can be 5-20x and pure polars can be 10-30x.The main thing I love about polars are sinks and lazyframes.

I don’t know if its right - only time will tell:-1 - get really good a defining and documenting for AI and business. How do I get an Agent to accelerate my work via context and not code. How do I show others the value I’m generating via acceleration of skills and effect using LLMs. Outcomes are all that count - 99% success but no value to business or customers doesn’t count as a win. 2 - the technology moats will come down. Oracle tech stack isn’t going to be a thing in 2 years. You’re a plumber of data and the stack/implementations matter less as the coast of replacing them is coming down at a huge rate. Tech debt suddenly has way lower interests rates. 3 - get good at big data again. Small stuff is gonna be usurped - that’s light work for a LLM. Big data is going to be hard because of cost and time. Start with YouTube - it’s a mess of influencers and hype men but there is some gold in there. Microsoft have a bunch of free GitHub learning on AI, ML, Big data on their repos. https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners is one. But they gave many. One thing to remember - the AI coding hype cycle has been around for 2 or so years of any value. You are still smarter than AI for sure. It can just type and think faster than you.

That works actually, better than what I was expecting.Where these frameworks usually die is when people try to stretch them into solving the hard 20% - business logic, weird timestamps, broken upstream APIs, one-off edge cases,. At that point you are building a DSL inside YAML, and nobody wants to debug YAML on friday.The happy middle ground is metadtaa drives ingestion and standard bronze/silver handling.

o29kh4v,"Agreed with other comments that this comparison doesn't make much sense, but just to go into a little more detail as to why...BigQuery and Athena are both serverless cloud offerings. BigQuery abstracts away storage *and* compute. Athena abstracts away only compute, as you need to connect it to your object storage, but fundamentally, it's at least a little similar as an offering. You're not managing infrastructure with either of them, and they'll scale up parallelization to whatever level is necessary to ensure you get query results back in a reasonable amount of time. Because they're both built on serverless billing models, costs are very high on a query-by-query basis, but this can still be competitive in a real-world scenario if you have relatively low daily utilization.Compare that to DuckDB, where you're using dedicated hardware with an embedded, columnar database. It abstracts away nothing - you're providing the hardware for storage and the hardware for compute. This is radically different. It works well at small scales, and because you're managing everything, it's great for heavy utilization and is extremely cost-effective on a query-by-query basis. It's also not distributed at all. Once you scale up past what a single machine can handle, you have graduated from DuckDB and need to move to something that can distribute the workload and handle scale.Fundamentally, they're different tools solving different problems. So when you run a benchmark with 20 GB of data, you're using a very small scale of data that DuckDB is built for and which BigQuery/Athena are not. Because there's no downtime in benchmarking, you're also simulating what is effectively 100% utilization, the least favorable scenario for a serverless billing model. Of course DuckDB is going to end up looking good.The way to meaningfully compare them on cost, at least, if you were for some reason trying to decide between these different options, would be to look at a simulated full month of usage. The hardware you're running DuckDB on costs \~$1500 for a month on EC2, or maybe \~$7500 in up front hardware costs if you have it on-site. You'd need to run \~1700 queries a day on BigQuery to get a similar monthly bill, or \~13500 of the narrow queries on Athena. You could certainly cut your hardware costs for DuckDB by a lot for this workload, but also, are you running 13000 queries a day?",InfluxCole,2026-01-28 18:52:46,4,dataengineering,t3_1qon39x,False,

Its less about job title at a certain point if you find the ebb and flow and can learn tools to do what the business needs. I did that for 2 years before I considered my self good enough to be called a professional and not a junior. Maybe you move faster than that. Also Migrating from an old system to a new system is a part of the cycle. Snowflake and Fabric are current generation cloud tech, so you are getting a free education on how to use them, take advantage of it!Ask yourself, How would you build this whole system? What does the whole system look like? Data engineering isn't just ETL, its a big part of it but the data modeling and being able to serve the overall system is the important part. Do you understand the whole system?Timeline to understand when to move is kind of irrelavent. Actually understanding and being able to apply those skills is when you make a move. You don't just set that to arbitrary 6/12/24 month timelines. When you gain the capability and understanding thats when you can think about moving to the next thing. There is always a next thing. Back when I started there was only MSQL 2000 and Crystal reports or SSRS. Now there are 50 different technologies to do the same with python , Java, or C#. So tools have gotten more sophisticated. Pick a path, learn that path, maybe use claude code/Code assistant of choice to help you build one, then read and understand how its built. Look up tutorials from youtube and compare that to your solution. Read the libraries and documentation that make it work. Then go from there. Build a whole program that takes in data to do something useful. Kaggle has a bunch of examples for this.

o2fm7bs,"Hi, a few things to consider.\- Data Talks Zoom Camp uses GCP, whereas Data Engineering by Joe Reis uses AWS. Even though the cloud technology you use doesn't matter much to learn the concepts, it's still better to start with what you are interested in. \- Zoom Camp is semi-structured and felt all over the place with some GitHub content, YouTube videos, past Cohort links, etc. For someone like me, it's very easy to deviate and lose interest. \- Joe Reis's course is well structured with a lot of optional material and paired with the Fundamentals of Data Engineering as the course's textbook. The assignments follow a similar structure to other Andrew NG's courses. Not too tough to pass. But, still a lot to explore and learn. \- ZoomCamp is free but uses a sponsored orchestrator. The deeplearning course uses Airflow, which is considered standard. Of course, there is Dagster and a few other tools gaining traction. So, this is not too significant either. \- ZoomCamp is tweaked and updated every year. But the DeepLearning course stays the same. But since it's a very recent release, it still covers the most popular tools and concepts, such as Lakehouse architecture, dbt, text data processing for AIML workloads, etc. \- ZoomCamp has a strict deadline to get the certificate. You will still achieve it if you start now. I assume the score weightage is mostly on the capstone project. For the Deep Learning one, you can keep paying and extending as long as needed.Overall, I tried to finish Zoomcamp multiple times and was distracted, but I am in the final module of the Deep Learning course.",mothikikm,2026-01-29 16:15:20,5,dataengineering,t3_1qq4aw3,False,

Some of the others are less so, but overall it's pretty solid. I'm half way through Joe Reis's Deeplearning and I'm torn on whether to finish it or not. A lot of the videos are reiterating a lot of content from his book (Fundamentals of Data Engineering). It goes over a lot of the soft skills that a good DE needs, but less so on the technical side. His class spends a lot of time within AWS and you do pick up some skills with it, so it's not too bad, but I don't feel like it was sticking with me after the class was done.Personally, do a few of the DataTalks zoomcamps - it has you writing and doing more than the other courses. And since the zoomcamps can occasionally miss some steps, it will force you to either interact with the other students or hone your research skills in order to make things work correctly.Lastly, you can go back through the DataTalks github and look at previous cohorts - they change up their tech stack some. One year used Airflow for their orchestration, the next used Dagster and they might be using another one now.

o1z49b4,"I generally push for using sql whenever possible but there's still 2 things that we have to use python.For extractions, I have some helper/utility code that handles generic things like abstracting away some API connections and setting up connections to datalake. The main python asset imports those helpers and then executes the actual logic of batch processing the extraction and loading to our datalake (hive configured).For transformations, we have mostly moved away from python to sql since we can directly query external tables created from our hive datalake. But we still sometimes use python for the first layer where the data is weird file formats (like grib, netcdf, etc.) that require special processing - in such cases we read the files, convert to a dataframe, and then materialize it in our dwh. Our data platform's own built-in python materialization automatically handles incremental strategies and variable injections.There are also very rare cases where data needs to be processed in a way thats not possible with sql - for example decoding airport weather reports like metar/taf, which require special python libraries to decode.To answer your question about frameworks - we write functional code with very minimal object-oriented programming. For my team the rule of thumb is that a single python file/asset should contain all the logic tied to a single data entity/table/model. We never use notebooks (unless for quick local testing and adhoc stuff). In some cases, we extract different data from a single API endpoint, so for those cases we create a separate agent/helper to connect to the API and configure the parameters - this is the only case where we use a bit more oop.",uncertainschrodinger,2026-01-27 07:02:32,7,dataengineering,t3_1qo49nt,False,

Write everything that you want the program to do down. Specify it. Every feature, every function. First, in a coarse overview and then flesh out each feature/function in detail.This document is the base for your programming. Everything in there is what you need to do. Not more, not less. If you have an idea to extend it, *append* it to the document, but do not yet even think about implementing it. Get the basic functionality working first. All that you append is ""optional"".The key to everything is the FDS. The more time and consideration you spend on it, the better you plan, the easier it will become to implement.Vague specifications help nobody and lead only to the block you describe.> someone suggested tools that help you plan before coding. tried verdent and a few others.Dedicated tools are not necessary. A simple text editor, or a proper text processor (like Word, Libre/OpenOffice Write, Google Documents) are all you need to get started. Don't overthink the tooling here. The more specialized a tool is, the more time you have to spend *learning* it, the less you can focus on the actual *content*. Simpler is better in that case.> theres so many decisions before you write a single lineAnd this is exactly what is necessary. The better you plan, the better your outcome.*Code* is the unimportant part of programming. It's only a necessary evil that we need to tell the computer what we want it to do. The *planning*, the *decisions*, the *considerations* are what really count.*Code* can be implemented by every ""code monkey"", but *planning* is what makes a *software engineer/designer*.I can give a well prepared FDS to somebody who can write code, but doesn't understand anything about the type of software I want to make and they will be able to program it.Yet, there isn't a detailed FDS, even the best programmer will be completely lost.-----Where you actually start, at the database, at the main functionality, is a different matter and often preference.I like to start with the database so that I have my fundamental construct.Then, I work on the main entry point of the program - this is the very first actual *code* that I write - it's sort of the ""ice breaker"".The biggest hurdle is always the first line, the first few statements. After that, the flow becomes natural. Yet, of course, this requires experience, and it will get easier with gained experience.----As always with similar posts, some books to consider:+ ""Think Like A Programmer"" by V.

You already made a partial ""list"" in your post. And then implement these one by one. Does not matter if you make a UI first, a database first or a backend/API first. Then it is just however you test that the thing works, it differs. With database you have to use SQL queries. With API you have to use REST calls (unless you use something other besides REST). etc. The order does not matter in your case.Yes, there is a system design and architecture and such in real life projects and some things do have an order, but you are just figuring out how to implement a thing and how a stuff works. Do not consider how the things are done in the real life. Before you haven't made a working app.And yes, there are many decisions before you write a single line. The same way there are many decisions before you lay the first brick when building a house. You can't just lay bricks anywhere you want or however you want. Software development has a planning phase. But this is where the splitting it all into pieces and putting into a list comes in. Why I mentioned it in my first paragraph. Create a list of achievable micro-goals and start implementing these one by one. Your app is an ""app"" (e.g. a mobile app)? Cool. Pick some totally random tutorial for getting the most barebones mobile app up and running. If it is not an ""app"" as a mobile app but a web application then pick a simple ""Hello world"" web application tutorial, to get it to return ""Hello world"" when run. If your application has a graphical side then get whichever ""canvas"" type working first. And then just add features on that canvas.",mandzeete,2026-01-26 08:10:39,4,learnprogramming,t3_1qn9sxt,False,
o1smrq0,"“Measure twice, cut once.” A few hours of planning out your architecture, pipelines, UI, etc can save you days or weeks of refactors down the line. Once you’ve done that. Others have suggested specific design document formats but I think the most important thing is to have something you can use to guide your programming. It should be detailed and specific enough that you could hand it to an experienced programmer and they’d have enough information to start implementing.I’d also suggest having a concept of an “MVP”, or “minimum viable product”. What’s the absolute minimum set of features that constitute a version of the idea that you’d be happy with? Start with that, add the rest of your ideas afterwards.I personally find that it’s easiest to start with something that I can actually see working, so for example in your budgeting app you can start with a page that displays your budget overview. Where does the budget information come from? Don’t worry about that yet, just add some hard-coded numbers. Once you’ve done that pick a number that you want to be “real” and build that, hooking it up to the UI. Now you have one real field and a bunch of fake ones. Pick another field to actually implement.

o1sv0a4,"Some of the methods I have seen over time: * Identify then build the core functionality first. * Build an MVP.* Write down sentences that are simple statements about the process you are trying to automate.* Write down the user journey.* Take a sheet of paper and outline all the objects. * Take a sheet of paper and outline all the functions.What it all comes down to is that you design at least part of the app before you code the app, although often it is also a process that goes back and forth. The other day I was coding a game and about halfway through I realised that the graphics library I was using was too slow for the game I was making. I had to swap to a different library and luckily (this time!) my code did not contain many assumptions about how the graphics work, so the swap was relatively pain free. **Write down sentences that are simple statements about the process you are trying to automate:** E.g.: * The app tells me how much money I have left. * I enter something I have bought.* I enter something I wish to buy.* What I have bought has a name and a price.You can think of these as questions you need to answer. If you were the budget planner for a large organisation, there would be questions people would continuously ask you. If you wrote those down and for every question you wrote down how come you know the answers, you would have the beginnings of a system.Real processes used by real people can tell you a lot about what your app must be able to handle. If you start with ""I would like a steak cooked by a Michelin level chef"" you are probably going to get there slower than if you start with ""what goes into a really good steak and who can tell me this?""**Identify then build the core functionality first:**If you want to start a website that can handle a billion requests per second, start with the code the takes then dispatches the requests (load balancers). For a much quieter website you would probably tackle other tasks first.If you want to make a game in which you fly a space ship, fight pirates and trade goods, make sure the ship handles well (i.e. the interface in which the user spends 95% of their time). Figuring out what the core functionality is though can be the real brainteaser.If there are parts of your app that are a known quantity (i.e. others have already solved this bit and documented their solutions) and parts that are not, the latter might be a good candidate. What is your USP, what makes your app stand out from the others?Example: [how the video game Lemmings was designed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5-lH3lZqrg) (YT, 4 mins).",brankoc,2026-01-26 11:32:51,3,learnprogramming,t3_1qn9sxt,False,

I've been assured by every exec ever that anyone can build apps with LLMs now... /sAssuming we're talking web applications, after I've got the spec/requirements down I've always liked to start with the data. So I will usually design database schemas to 3NF and write the DDL. I can then use this to bring up a database instance. Then I write a quick DML seeding script. Then I put together a server application in whatever language I've chosen. I've been around a while so I've written a good few auth/perm systems so I have code for that in JS/PHP which is usually what I'm using. Then I work on the back end API, adding things I need as I go (e.g. job queues, caching, etc.) Finally, I put the client together (personally my least favourite part, maybe why I do it last if it's me doing it). There's usually no reason you need to do back/front in any particular order and it's common to do them in parallel too (different teams etc.). I do think that starting with the data, which flows through the entire app, adds a certain clarity and certainty to things, but really anything goes if you don't mind lots of going back to revise.My ""plan"" is usually my thinking beforehand and any diagrams I've doodled, as we don't create formal design docs as part of our process. We gather requirements, write software, document the result. I will put effort into writing a technical design doc if I'm handing it off entirely though. I basically short-circuit the written spec part if I'm also the implementer.For a personal project, I think the answer is to just think, and make whatever notes/doodles you feel are necessary. How do you want to distribute/deliver it to users? What data is needed at what point? What interactions? How do you want interactions to go? How do you want it to look? Do you need common things that a framework would be able to provide? Etc.Things that you haven't considered will usually present themselves. Things you have considered will change.

For backend, you have django, fastapi. Learn languages via courses teaching about these fields. If you simply want to learn about python syntax then codecademy is a great place to start at. Get a basic grip on the language and move to its practical applications in the fields instead. For example, you can start with the iris dataset classification in data science. It'll yeach you about the basics of machine learning and about python programming. Using a library like scikit-learn will abstract away the algorithm and allow you to do plug and play approach.

When you figure out your studies and you feel that the studying process is going well, then sure, you'll have a chance. Not right now.And even when you figure it out then you'll have an uphill battle ahead.

People without a degree have little chance.So, you'll have two obstacles: figuring out the study process itself (as you are stuck right now) and figuring out why the company should hire YOU.My advice would be going for a degree. Like this you'll have a structured study plan made ready by people who know the industry. You'll have more options available. More doors opened for you. And you being 36 does not mean it is too late to go for a degree. I did a career change when I was 28-32. Got my degree when I was 32 and got hired then. Followed it up with Master degree studies as well. We had guys in their 30s studying with course mates 10 years younger than them. No issues what so ever. Some few were also in 40s.If, for some reason you are not going for a degree then you have to start building real life projects that will be taken into a real use either by you, your family and friends, or by somebody else.

o1p9rob,"> it demoralizes meFirst up, school has misled you on how easy it is to learn new things. They didn't mean to do it, but they did. What do I mean by that? You spend years slowly spiralling your knowledge and understanding of a topic over years, probably for 12 or 13 years at the minimum. As such, when you are introduced to a 'new topic', it's 98% old knowledge. It is built on structures where a lot of the new thinking is given to you and slowly removed bit by bit until you are doing it yourself. This teaches you are taught that learning isn't really too hard, and you should be succeeding almost immediately before moving to the next topic. When you learn something novel it's not a slow progression over years, it's probably a logistics function of logistic functions for each topic. That is, the initial concept is pretty easy, then it becomes hard as fuff where you feel like an idiot for ages, but you eventually learn the concept and it gets easy. But, because you are constantly learning, at no point do you ever feel like a master, or even competent. I firmly believe that 'good' programmers are people who accept that they will always struggle stuff that they are just learning and can realise exactly how much they've learned. So, what's the lesson for you?- Accept that you might need to take smaller steps, and that's okay. - After you learn something, make your own version of the questions/problems, and solve them as well. If you can't do that, go back to their questions and just change one small thing (like a variable) and write down what you think will change when you run it and then run it. Document if it runs the way you thought, and if it doesn't, keep playing until you get it. Then move to two things, then as many things as you can. - Think back to other things you've learned and ask yourself if you can incorporate those things as well, if so (and you probably can), make your own versions of those problems. You'll likely find that giving yourself that space to learn how to solve those problems will mean that the next step will be easier.",AUTeach,2026-01-25 22:00:10,3,learnprogramming,t3_1qmlfi8,False,

Programming is like programming. Believe me when I say my brain does work in similar ways, and I understand why you are trying to create these abstractions, but be careful because they can be misleading.For example, in your model, a web application might be a bunch of separate ""flowcharts"" that share parts of their path. It really does depend what you are building.The problem of, ""how do people keep track of all these branching paths stretching out to infinity"". Well, I don't do that.

Yes, it doesn’t branch infinitely in a literal sense the way a fractal might, but there are almost always far too many twists and turns to keep in your head all at the same time. Most real programs are more like a circle than a straight path, and the only reason that thats even true is that we write them to work that way so that we have some chance at reasoning about them.The good news, though, is that you don’t need to keep it all in your head at the same time. Programming is a never ending exercise in abstraction. To do the work, you only need to worry about the one piece that you’re working on at any moment. If you’re writing a function that computes a value based on its parameters, you don’t care where those parameters came from. If you’re calling another function, you don’t need to worry about how it does what it does — you only care about *what* it does (and sometimes how long it takes). Considering (and especially depending on) things outside the function can even be a liability.I’m glad that you’re sticking with it!

(But since unittest is build into the standard library, maybe give it a try and write some simple tests for the functions you change!)\- ""but I’m worried that even then it will still feel messy"". Yes, it will still feel messy, but thats just the first step, that enables the next ones. Its a journey and while the goal ""tidy code"" can be helpful as motivation it can also be overwhelming. \- Talking about ""proceeding in steps"": A simple technique that can help is identifying sections in code, lines that belong together. Give these sections a comment saying what the section does. Then try to pull out that section into a function. The function name now can take the task that the comment had: It tells what happens, without the need to reading the whole function. Try to make the function only rely on the parameters you pass to it instead of ""global state"" (also called a ""pure function""). This makes the function easy to test and to understand. This might not always be easy, but at least check if its possible. \- There are a lot of helpful texts there – [https://refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru) is a good online resource, Fowlers book ""Refactoring"" is also pretty helpful.

o27trby,"One of the things I like to do is not to factor into ""substeps"", but more like ""next steps"". Taking a big function and then making functions out of it often means that you're just switching between different functions, but have the same complexity. That's often actually worse.Breaking things down into ""input, process, output"" helps dramatically, especially if you can then extract the ""output"" to a separate method/object. If your big function makes a call to an API, does something with it, makes a call to another API, etc? Try to separate at those boundaries, or push things to the end. A useful pattern can be to gather up all of the changes you want in your function, and then apply them at the end.One strategy I've often used is to ""chop the tail"". What that means is finding the very last thing the function does, and then creating a new function at that point, taking all of the data it needs as parameters. You can then work through the function as a whole. This differs from the ""substep"" method because you can, when you make that final call, basically forget about what happened before that. If you call that last function with the right parameters, then the previous function was correct.

LinkedIn? Meetups? Or is it just something people say for the sake of saying? Networking is getting out and talking to people, not shooting messages into the avoid and hoping someone looks at your social media and goes ""this kids a genius"", thats not networking.You need to find meetup groups in your area and start attending, meetup.com. This is a good way to get out there but with networking, you get out what you put in.If you just go, attend, and don't talk to anyone, no ones going to know who you are / what you are doing tech wise and what you're looking for. So if you aren't socially outgoing, start working on that.>I kind of feel like I wasted most of college procrastinating. Now I’m doing DSA and web dev, but its late-very late and I know it.

They setup temporary shelters and take intake on paper where if they had a laptop there, they'd cut that part out.Look at rec leagues in your area and see if any of these rec leagues have a need for software to manage teams/schedules/rosters.

o21lfnq,"I learned C from books because I am old. ;) But more seriously: check the library for an intro to C textbook. Every one I've ever seen was at least a good intro.I wouldn't be too worried about being embarrassed in labs about beginner mistakes; that's what class is for. If you already knew C, the class wouldn't be helpful.Relative to other languages, it helps to understand C's memory model, because it's a lot closer to what actually happens under the hood in the computer and getting confused about it is the source of a lot of errors. So, in C, you have two places data is stored in memory: the stack and the heap. The stack is where any variables in your functions live. If you say `int number = 5;`, that puts a `5` on the stack (hey folks who actually know C: yes, I know about registers, keeping it simple to start with, yeah?). Generally, stuff on the stack lives there until the function returns, then *everything* on the stack for that function goes away. That's all the variables you declared in your function and everything passed into the function (all the stuff passed into a function, the function gets a copy of).The heap is where longer-lived stuff goes. You get a chunk of heap by going `int* pointer_to_number = malloc(sizeof(int));`. That gives you some int-sized chunk of memory somewhere, and what `malloc` actually returns is a *pointer* to that memory. Now, `pointer_to_number` is a variable (on the stack) that holds an address of something in the heap. You can treat the pointer like a number (if you try to print it and tell print ""it's a number,"" for example, it'll just be the memory address where the data is stored). If you want to modify the data on the heap, you can go `*pointer_to_number = 13;`. The star there means ""I want to mess with the stuff pointed to, not the pointer itself."" If you wanted to change what the pointer points to, you could go `pointer_to_number = pointer_to_some_other_number;`. Note the lack of a star.Now here's the place where people get messed up most often: C has no way to know when you're done with the memory `malloc` gave you. It needs *you* to tell it that. So when you're all done with the memory you got handed, you call `free(pointer_to_number);`. That will say to the memory manager ""Hey, that pointer you malloc'd me awhile back? All done with it; something else can use that memory."" If you forget to do that, when your function returns and the variables holding the pointer go away, the pointed-to memory can't be found anymore and you ""leaked"" it; that memory is stuck with a 'used' flag on it and nobody else can use it.The other thing about C is that it's a language with few 'guardrails' and makes it very easy to screw up the memory model or machine state. If you call `free` twice on the same pointer, you probably just break the memory manager and it'll do screwy stuff in your program from that point forward (modern operating systems give every program its own copy of `malloc` itself so you can't break the *whole computer's* state that way; worst-case-scenario, you can always quit the program and when it terminates all the memory it was using is properly given back to the operating system, including anything `malloc`'d). If you `malloc` a small amount of memory and then try to cram something big in there, C will cheerfully write the big thing past the end of the memory you reserved and clobber whatever's in the next chunk of memory. If you take a pointer to something on the stack (using the `&` operator) and then try to hold onto that pointer and then return from the function where that stack-thing lives, it'll get freed but your pointer will still be around and now it's pointing to the wrong thing. And probably the biggest foot-gun in the language: strings are just pointers to the first character of the string, so if you `malloc` some memory to hold a string and then forget now much you malloc'd and write a longer string than will fit in that memory, you will rip right into some other data in memory squirting random characters into it and you'll have a bad time.In a lot of ways, C is *way* simpler than other languages.

It's fine if you do this for a while, but the diminishing returns become heavy after. This is because newcomers don't yet have the necessary exposure and knowledge to do ""new things"", therefore they just fall in the trap of: learn new language -> learn basic syntax -> pretty much do nothing actually minimally important (to your learning) with this language -> get bored because you pretty much did nothing -> learn new language.\- Try to diversify your initial learning over several areas of computing: graphics, distributed systems, embedded systems, operating systems, application development (web & mobile), and so on... Quick extra tip: place your effort into learning operating systems more, everything nowadays use an operating system as a basis, and therefore having at least a minimal understanding of how they work is important.\- Try spending the majority of your time in an actual low-level programming such as C. I wouldn't recommend C++ just yet, because it won't give the same effect to a beginner as C does, this is because since C++ abstracts some stuff, beginners are prone of thinking about some features as an ""API"", which is not really what is happening, and this creates the exact opposite effect of what we want, since APIs in programming are usually perceived as a black box, and you don't want a black box, you want to actually understand what is going on. Just an additional note: I'd recommend coupling low-level programming learning with your OS studies.\---------I'd take my advices with a grain of salt however, because it really depends on what stage you already are, and what type of approach you have towards your learning process.

Ask yourself this, if the new job is Python or Rust based can you adapt quickly to use those tools. Frankly I don't see much of a future for C#.The other side of this is how much have you developed completely on your own. If you successfully have completed the design and implementation of a novel program or two you are off to a good start. Frankly you should make this code available for review by the community. Code reviews can be painful but they can keep you on the right tracks as your skills develop. To put it another way if you haven't had your current programing reviewed by a third party you might not be as ready as you think.Now how quickly you might get hired depends upon demand and in many cases experience and knowledge outside of programming. You mention ""office Job"" but that does not define much. What I'm trying to say here is that sometimes other knowledge can be a factor in getting a job. If you have in depth knowledge of part of a business it can make programming a lot easier to adapt to because otherwise as a programmer you have to understand the business logic before you can even write code.

What data structures (at least: Arrays, Lists, Dictionaries, Stacks and Queues) are.After that, then you can go to the game engine.If you mean the whole ""getting used to your environment"" - start by following a short game tutorial, and then adding functionality to it (make flappybird, then add a coin collecting mechanic - or extra life pickups). This will teach you where things are, and how to get there. When following the tutorial, don't follow line by line, but section by section. Watch for a few minutes, and then repeat it on your own trying not to reference the video.

Think about what you want to accomplish, and quantify it. If it ain't quantifiable, explain it as a story that gives quantifiable metrics. We call these Functional & Non-functional/Quality Requirements. Define and prioritize those first. Once you know exactly what it is you want to make, start to break that thing down into identifiable entities, their components, and their relationships to everything else. Think about how the game works, and the major parts of it.* Look up SOLID programming principles, and Object Oriented Design Patterns. They are incredibly helpful in game dev, because they teach you how to arrange ideas in a way that's typically useful for simulations like games* When in doubt about how certain things work, read the docs. They are dense, but they're by far the most useful resource at your disposal.* Follow a consistent coding style.

o2v3oi6,"Biggest obstacle to understanding the C/C++ is pointers and how process memory is mapped into a ram. At first we don't know that there's thing called Virtual Memory which controls every aspect of memory access. The executable .data section is baked into a file (.exe on Windows, elf file format on Linux) so its size is static/constant, never changes its size when the process is running. So it's not that suitable for allocating new memory for data in the future. So the OS have a mechanism (heap) for requesting new memory pages in order for a program to be able to create new objects while it's running. If not for pointers we wouldn't be able to refer to objects located in heap because we don't know beforehand where they would be located, the compiler knows only about variables on the .data section.

I see you mention wanting to be proficient in AppSec and AI, then it is important to understand that there is more to this than just the language. Many times, when in comes to the language it is just the tool you use to apply logic and with that said AppSec and AI both rely heavily on the fundamentals of Computer science concepts. Discrete math, Data structures and algorithms, operating systems fundamentals, networking basics, databases, etc. With all that said, the one thing you can look at that credentializes you while teaching you all the relevant concepts is a Comp Sci degree. Especially with your stated goals. If you can't get a degree, then focus on first building the foundation for a self made CS curriculum. Appsec in particular isn't just finding bugs in front end code, it includes threat modeling, devops and other infra principles, tons of code review, database management, etc. AI security is emerging in 2 forms. The first being red/blue team tradecraft oriented security. So hacking the models through prompt injection, data poisoning, first order attacks etc. The second form is securing the models themselves, which is actually more inline with the AI/ML engineer/MLOps skillset, the best way to get into this is to pursue a traditional AI focused CS program. Notice, how everything comes back to CS fundamentals. Not assuming you want to jump into a senior position, but security isn't really a beginner focused field. In order to do security properly, you need the knowledge of an engineer and the knowledge of someone who can actually break the app and recommend remediation. Lofty goals is what keeps us motivated, but I would break down your goals in meaningful steps and a meaningful timeline. To answer what you would use to learn programming and CS fundamentals, the only course that ever stuck with me was a ""bootcamp"" I took last year for $150 from exercism. They didn't even use a real language for the first half of the course, yet the fundamentals they taught have still stuck with me today. The biggest benefit from this course however was their discord where mentors were there to help guide you to answers on your own.

I focused on the math and discrete math fundamentals, before jumping back into doing algorithm problems to improve my thinking.

You start with microcontroller firmware and USB.⸻Step 1: Pick a microcontroller and read its datasheet like scriptureMost custom keyboards use:•ATmega32U4 (classic Arduino Pro Micro)•RP2040•STM32The key requirement: native USB device support.Before writing any keyboard code, you must understand:•GPIO configuration•Timers / interrupts•USB endpoints•Flash + RAM limitsThis is not optional. QMK hides this pain; you’re choosing to feel it.⸻Step 2: Implement a matrix scanner (this is the soul)A keyboard PCB is usually a row × column matrix.Algorithmically:•Set all columns as outputs•Set all rows as inputs with pull-ups•Drive one column LOW at a time•Read rows•Repeat fast (≈1 kHz)You will write:•GPIO init•A scan loop•A key state bitmapThis alone teaches you more embedded thinking than most app devs ever touch.⸻Step 3: Debouncing (time becomes real)Switches lie. They bounce.You need:•Per-key state•Timestamp or counter•Stable-state confirmationClassic strategies:•Integrator counters•Time-based debounce•State machinesQMK has multiple debounce algorithms. Rewriting one is a rite of passage.⸻Step 4: Build a key event pipelineAt this point you have:•Raw matrix state•Press / release eventsNow you design your own internal API:raw_scan → debounced_state → key_event → actionThis is where you can do things QMK doesn’t:•Probabilistic chording•Pressure-aware timing•Contextual layers (editor-aware, app-aware)This is where creativity lives.⸻Step 5: USB HID from scratch (the dragon)Now the hard truth:USB is the real boss fight.You must implement:•USB descriptors•HID report descriptors•Polling interval logic•Key rollover handlingYou can:•Write USB by hand (brutal but pure)•Or use a thin USB stack (LUFA, TinyUSB) without keyboard logicThis is still “from scratch” in spirit—USB is a protocol, not magic.⸻Step 6: Layers, macros, and remapping (language emerges)Layers are just:•Lookup tables•Stackable keymaps•State-dependent resolutionMacros are:•Event playback engines•Timed HID reportsNothing mystical. QMK only organizes it well.⸻Where to actually learn this (non-obvious sources)Not “keyboard tutorials.” Those are downstream.Study instead:•USB HID specification•LUFA examples (keyboard + mouse)•Bare-metal MCU tutorials•Old AVR keyboard firmware (pre-QMK era)Then read QMK last, like reading a cathedral after learning how stones are cut.⸻A sharper insight most people missQMK is not a keyboard firmware.QMK is:•A hardware abstraction layer•A policy engine for input•A build system that normalizes chaosIf you rebuild it, don’t clone it.Design something smaller, stranger, and opinionated.For example:•A keyboard that adapts layout based on typing entropy•A keyboard that changes layers by time-of-day•A keyboard optimized for African language input patterns•A keyboard that treats macros as code, not sequencesThat’s how you go beyond “my own QMK” and into new instruments.",AltruisticSteak3952,2026-01-29 10:27:54,3,learnprogramming,t3_1qq414s,False,

The main difference is that TypeScript helps future you (or your teammates) read your code easier. All of the knowledge you learn in JavaScript is transferable. You’re not wasting time learning JS.

You're trying to learn by doing the test over and over again until you pass, rather than taking the class. Not only is that a highly inefficient way to pass the test, it also means you're not going to learn the material on the way..> And I'll have to do two of these in under an hour?!?! Am I really just this completely awful at the job I had for so long, in the field I'm stuck in?Unpopular opinion: Yeah.Algorithms and data structures are an integral part of our craft. Just because we can often get away with not paying due attention to them doesn't mean that produces quality results, or that there will never be situations where they don't matter.If you were an accountant, I would expect you to be able to do so e basic math, whether all of your actual work was fine with the aid if a calculator or not, too.Furthermore, it's a test. It doesn't aim to, or need to, be a perfect representation of your work day. I would ask you to look for the video of Gordon Ramsey being able to butcher a chicken while blindfolded. Other than a stunt done for TV, it is a test of his raw skills. And even though few chefs will ever find themselves having to perform that particular task, I'd trust anyone who can do it more than anyone who can't.The good news is that any competent chef should be able to learn to perform this trick fairly quickly and easily. So, if companies decided that this is what chefs should do to get hired, no real chef should have a problem. (And, therefore, the test would work as expected: Filter out the vast majority of really bad chefs. That it also filters out some number of decent chefs that just can't be bothered with the parlour trick is not an issue for the restaurant.)",okayifimust,2026-01-29 07:58:52,13,cscareerquestions,t3_1qq1vea,False,

You should be aiming for code quality that *exceeds* the quality of your prior manual output, and you should always understand the details of how it all works - neither of which are very hard if you leverage the AI to do this (e.g. get it to refactor when needed, use other AI tools to review the code, ask for explanations).Most ""vibe coders"" don't do this, and that's where tech debt problems come in quickly.

Two weeks off just really isn't enough time for that, I think it's just the beginning of the healing process.The only difference between switching environments or not seemed to be when I come back as an existing employee people expect me to hit the ground running at full speed just like I was before. This can be stressful, but it's balanced against already knowing people's expectations and team dynamics and office politics and how to do the work. In fact the times I wanted to quit my job the most were in those first couple months after a sabbatical at a new job. Combining onboarding with a new company with suddenly becoming a corporate slave again is especially painful. It may be worth noting that I stayed at both those new companies for a while after pushing through the feeling of existential dread.",trg0819,2026-01-28 17:14:02,35,cscareerquestions,t3_1qpgan8,False,

Just a month ago I landed my first SWE job. There are definitely go guarantees, and it will likely take a while but its definitely not impossible. My advice would be to focus on 1. Projects: Building projects that you can talk about and show in some way, whether it be a demo of the project, a blog, or anything else. With AI you can pretty much just pick any topic you are interested in, find something that seems interesting to build and is within a reasonable scope and build it. Bonus points if its a product that solve actual peoples problems, product thinking is highly valued at startups. The goal is to show people that you have actually done stuff, and to be able to talk about it.2. Network: The most universal thing I learned after a year of searching for jobs was that pretty much everyone I knew got their job through some sort of connection and is also how I ended up getting my job, and this is doubly true in todays market. Network as aggressively as you can (not annoyingly but just a lot of people) and reach out to your own personal network. The cost is basically nothing other than maybe your ego, and the upside is tremendous, you never know who could be the one that has the connect, and people are very often happy to help. Definitely still apply to companies but don't spend too much time on it especially if you aren't getting much positive feedback. Your first job will most likely be from just knowing the right person (networking) and actually having something to show for your skills (projects).

o2mneie,"Traditional engineer here (chemical, not that it matters)... turns out, USA vs. Europe area engineering or not that makes little difference. It looks like, checks the replies, a lot of software developers are just toxic regardless of where they live. A lot of you all are really arguing about stupid shit. Software development isn't a zero sum game, for US developers to win, EU doesn't have to lose, and vice versa.Do we chalk this up to people just being young? Do European posters in /r/cscareerquestions ALSO skew young and NOT actually employed as software developers, just like the US counterparts?Anyways, unlike many people here, I regularly during the course of my work, engage with large teams of European engineers. Primarily engineers from Ireland, Poland, and Germany. Ireland is unique, in that it also has a large diaspora of engineers from OTHER European countries. These have included multiple engineers from England, Spain, and France, and Architects from Ireland, Italy, and England.Two things that have helped dramatically, are: Persistent and clear communication. Both parties need to be patient, and be ""clear"" with their communication. English will be the lingua fraca, but all English is not the same. Focus on using COMMON, more likely to be known, phrases, words, etc. Avoid idioms that someone not from your country isn't going to know. It's REALLY common for native speakers/writers to go crazy with this and communicate in a way that is very difficult to understand. Simplify it down. Assume positive intent, if something SOUNDS off, it's probably a bad translation. Every language has it's own difficulties in translation to English. Above all else, patience by BOTH parties.The other, is absolutely when working with counterparts in other cultures, you HAVE to learn and understand what their leadership and accountability paradigm is, relative to yours. Do NOT assume it is the same way, at all, to yours. How people are led (do people DEFER to leadership, or INFORM leadership), how people are mentored, how people are held accountable, differs WILDLY between cultures; and, even within that culture, particularly in Poland I see big differences between junior and senior engineers. I suspect in that country there's a divide there too; if I had to guess, it's roughly the 15+ and above vs. the newer peeps. But, I don't fully understand, despite how much polish interaction I get.With that last one, comes ASSUME positive intent. Assume they WANT to get the job done, and done well, and seek to understand how and why they're behaving the way they are. A metaphor I like to use borrows from the old American story about the cherry tree and the axe. If ""Culture A"" was going to cut down a tree, and had 10 hours to do it, how many hours would they spend sharpening the axe?"" The polish would sharpen the axe, and a backup axe, for 9.5 hours. The Irish? They cut it down last week. My point? The spread between preparing for the act, and doing the act, varies wildly, and can be a VERY common source of frustration ALL around.Anyways, good luck.

Contracting companies put in a bid, one gets the contract, and then they have a cutover date when they will take over.Stupidly, many seem to think they can do the same job with half the people, half as qualified, find out they can't and then they need qualified bodies at a discount price.That's where you come in! You get to go pee in a cup and see if you can manage to get to a drug test without being drunk or high, and if you can, you get to go replace keyboards that aren't broken, screens that work, and generally throw out a lot of good equipment that ""nobody wants"" because someone else used it for a month.Once they figure out you can think, you will get called to ""blue screens if death"" where you turn on the second monitor and wonder why they are still running windows XP with all this corporate data, and in the network.You will get calls to figure out what is wrong with the computer that has some error on it that no one can tell you what it is, it says ""no ram detected"", but they can see the RAM in there, so it should be working, right?Don't forget the calls to unmute the executive microphones, dial phone numbers on touch screens; and turn on computers everyone said were on, but they were off (even though the blinky lights by the phone cable in the back are on).Make friends, hop jobs, hop contracts, (always sign the contract for the job you want regardless of what your current boss says they will give you, you can always decline of the boss comes through {but they won't}).After you've been doing that, look for work in your neck of the woods doing point of sale support and general IT for contracting companies.When you finally find the job you want and get, great, you will have lots of experience.If you are lucky enough to work at a place that has commute and they bus the workers in, bring a laptop and work on personal projects on the bus to and from work.",I_IdentifyAsAstartes,2026-01-29 07:47:46,18,cscareerquestions,t3_1qq10hb,False,

The brand name helps confirm your technical skills.Your current challenge is the total number of jobs you have held in a few years. You must change how you present your history during interviews. Instead of justifying why you left, explain that you have learned that high-growth startups do not provide the structure you need. State that you are now prioritizing stability and long-term projects.Focus your search on large companies in the automotive or consumer electronics sectors.

Once you have a few years experience there, look for jobs back home with contracting companies or actual companies themselves that support point of sale devices for merchants, do a few years of that.Then you have software, hardware, and point of sale support and you can do some social networking with local tech support companies and you might have better luck back home.The problem that I encountered when I was trying to break in, is I was competing with all these 40 year old people with 15 years experience that were moving back, and I just couldn't stand up against them.Now as it turns out where I am it is super rural, good help is hard to find, I found a great job, 20 min from my door to my desk, and it is a nice town; so I stayed, but I prefer a more rural setting.

o1rnp6m,"Your resume has significant room for improvement I have some recommendations that could make a major difference in how recruiters perceive your candidacy.The most critical issue is your experience section. You have too many bullet points per role (standard is 3 to 5 maximum but since its one company around 5 is okay, maybe 6 if it’s really really worth it), and more importantly, they lack substance. When you write something like “Diagnosed systemic product-line defects, implemented robust fixes,” you’re not telling recruiters anything useful. What defect did you find? What made your fix robust? What changed as a result? Right now you’re describing tasks instead of demonstrating impact.Every bullet point should follow a simple structure: what you achieved, how you did it, and ideally with numbers to back it up. Instead of listing what you did, show what happened because you did it. Compare “Implemented automated testing” to “Cut deployment time from 6 hours to 45 minutes by building an automated testing suite in Jenkins that caught 80% of bugs before production.” One is forgettable, the other proves you deliver results.Your summary section needs to go entirely. It takes up valuable space without adding value, and it creates a wall of text that makes recruiters skip to the next resume. Remember, most people spend under 10 seconds scanning your resume initially. Every line needs to earn its place.With that space freed up, add more projects. Keep a rotating collection you can swap based on the role you’re applying for. Tailor them to highlight relevant skills for each position. Your current project description is far too vague and you’re missing an opportunity. If university teams are actually using what you built, name them specifically. That transforms a generic claim into proof of real-world impact.If you want to preserve some of the context your summary provided, move your skills section to the top. This immediately tells recruiters what you bring to the table and helps them understand everything else they read through that lens.Your formatting also has problems. Company name, job title, and dates should all be on one line for ATS compatibility. Include months with your dates, not just years. Separating projects from education will also improve scannability and make both sections easier to parse quicklyHope I don’t come off as too harsh.

o2oodld,"In my opinion,You sound like me, 18 years ago. I kept chasing the dream and kept burning out and crashing. I wish I had been less stubborn and willing to listen to a mentor.I would recommend making the game development a hobby, make it for androids, and make it to fix specific table top game editions, like D&D.But I found that the more I worked at the fun, the less fun it was. Turns out I have a.d.h.d. and autism and if I had been able to be medicated through school, I would have been unstoppable.I was pretty bitter trying to find work in 2008-2011 in video games while learning and programming in C++ for ""the game"" I had in my head. Then once I would know what ""the game"" was, I would do some research and find out that someone else had the idea and had already done it.That's when it hit me, the ideas are a dime a dozen, and everyone has them; it's being able to make it into a reality and get it to market faster than the competition that gets the money.The secret, kookily enough, was watching the movie ""the secret"" and saying to myself ""If I am always saying that I am burned out and there are no jobs, then that is my reality"". So instead I said ""I am a positive person, pleasant to be around, I love people, and there are lots of jobs I would enjoy (each of those was a lie)"".I just had that mindset and I just flipped the job search rules on its head and I just applied for everything that looked interesting. I had one resume, one cover letter, a few letters of reference, and then I just ""cold job applied"", or ""shotgun approach"". I just stopped looking at the job, the description, the requirements, and instead of stressing about if I qualified for a job or tailoring my resume and cover letter for one hour and then applying for one job in two hours, I did a blanket google search, opened up the top ten results in tabs, and just went through uploading my resume and cover letter to sites and applying for as many jobs as I could. Some were an email, some were uploading documents, some were transcribing into their web fields, so some took a minute to apply to, some took 20 minutes. I just applied and applied and applied.I ""knew"" everyone else was going to be tailoring their resume to the job, so instead of me doing that for each one, I wrote the cover letter like it was a personal conversation between friends and I sold myself as an amazing worker and someone they wanted on their team.I'd been applying for about a day before I got a call for a job where they were looking for a permanent full time position (but I didn't know that cause I hadn't really read the job listing). I had a 2 year technical diploma and had just finished my 3rd year of a bsc in computer science, I was on summer break...So I went to the preliminary interview and fucking nailed it with my positive attitude and my honest answers of ""I don't know what that is or how to do it, but I honestly don't know what I am doing with most things. What I know how to do is know when I don't know, I know how to look something up, and I learn fast"".They ended up hiring me for a summer rather than any of the other full time applicants that they had. I fucking love automation and I get bored easily. It was a tech support job for a software development company, so everytime I answered a question, I templated the response. There's really only 20 questions anyone could have about this software, and I knew what they were cause I had been doing templated responses from May to July.In July I asked to get some screen recording and captioning software to make some tutorial videos; I made basic, intermediate, and advanced video tutorials, published them, and the calls stopped.I had automated myself out of a job, and then I went back to school and finished my fourth year.I had a competitive job offer from them half way through the year, full benefits, to come back and work for them. It was a great company, it got acquired during covid, but I did basically the same thing for them for 3 years before moving on.I just kept looking at something that had to be done more than once and figured out how to automate it.The moral of this story is sometimes you have to run before you can walk. Successfully selling yourself and taking initiative to do your job and improve everything, rather than just collecting a cheque allowed me to develop a specific set of skills.I work for a much bigger company now, ""work"" is a strong term. I do tech support and am on a team with other people where we get sent problems no one can figure out how to fix. We figure it out, fix it, and automate it.I never would have figured that out without actually doing it.",I_IdentifyAsAstartes,2026-01-30 22:06:02,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1qrg9a0,False,
o2oj6r7,"I have, but not anything I think is impressive. I’ve made a very short choose your own adventure style text based web game, I’ve worked on some games in game maker back when I was in high school but I don’t currently have access to what I made since it was for a class on the school’s computers, made some simple Scratch games as well as designing a board game in that same class back in the day. For related art stuff I’ve made some animations recently (2D hand drawn digital animations) such as a basic looping character walk cycle from one angle and a few other simple animations, and I’ve also drawn some 2D digital art for a very brief unfinished game demo group project in university too but I didn’t end up doing any of the code for that one. I’ve also made the very basic typical low quality snake game almost everyone does at some point. Also I found out I kinda suck at 3D animation and rigging in Blender.I think I’m probably more interested in the creative aspects (game design/mechanics, visuals, story/writing, characters) than actual coding but maybe I haven’t worked deep enough into the actual coding parts to really know for sure. I think maybe everything I’ve done so far is too surface level to really have a clear picture currently.

My only worry is the possibility that having formal diagnoses could lead to issues if I want to move out of the U.S. or cause discrimination based on having that on my medical record (more worried about autism as opposed to ADHD for that knowing how autistic people often get mistreated, seen as incompetent, and infantilized).",OssifiedAngel,2026-01-30 22:24:41,1,cscareerquestions,t1_o2oodld,True,

Full stack is frankly usually frontend leaning w/ some backend (think frontend who needs to deal with BFFs due to GraphQL or SSR), and ""full stack dev AI stuff"" isn't really a thing, in the sense of multiple specializations in one person. More typical is ML people dabbling w/ backend-ish things (often poorly) and other traditional roles (backend/frontend/etc) interfacing with each other through API contracts, which is just bog standard software engineering.LC is useful to the extent that you get to practice certain types of coding skills and patterns that CRUD/glue code development doesn't necessarily expose you to, but it isn't strictly necessary if you deal with things like graph traversal or memoization in their glorious raw forms (aka not relying too much on libs to do DS&A-ish things) on a semi-regular basis.

Begin with simple systems like URL shortener, chat app, and build up.I would suggest focusing on a single playlist until you have a comprehensive understanding of the foundational concepts. Concurrently, actively engage in diagramming and verbally articulating your understanding as you progress through the material.",Boom_Boom_Kids,2026-01-26 12:51:45,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1qms9e0,False,
o2vpqkt,"Using the Ai applicant stuff, in my opinion, just comes down to this. You simply become another statistic that complains about the job market, because you put in 3,500 resumes and got 4 total responses, 3 of which declined you and one got you through. In my experience so far just doing it by hand I have yet to have a job completely ghost me and I am currently sitting at 12 applications. Mind you these were all declines still, and I will have to hunt for a little while. I do use Ai, specifically for cover letters though, but more of a guidance than fully copy pasting. Everything comes from me, but using Ai to get the thoughts flowing rather than sitting there and spending an hour on each letter that nobody will read just makes sense. I can get the creative juices flowing and type away the letter in about ten minutes or so. So, there is certainly a usefulness to Ai.I also certainly do not want to tell you which way is better over the other. It is literally a matter of do you want to manually apply to 50 - 200 places and have a higher chance of hearing something back? Or do you just want to apply to every job on the planet and not hear zip except for a couple gold mines? Believe me, there are a ton of people out there not using Ai at all or even experienced it, so they get a letter that sounds like a robot typed it (if they read it), it is going right in the trash. So it is really just that, quality vs quantity, they both can win, and in this situation they both win at the same time and lose at the same time.",Infectedtoe32,2026-01-31 23:48:35,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1qsg68t,False,
