Beyond just practicing SQL syntax, focus on these data engineering-specific concepts for Shopify:1.​Performance thinking: When you write queries during the assessment, always consider ""how would this perform on millions of rows?"" Shopify deals with massive scale. Use EXPLAIN plans, avoid SELECT *, and think about index usage.2. ​Data quality patterns: Practice SQL for data validation, deduplication (ROW_NUMBER() OVER PARTITION BY), and identifying data anomalies. Real data engineering involves catching bad data before it breaks pipelines.3. ​Incremental processing: Since you mentioned building pipelines mostly in Python, practice SQL patterns for incremental loads—using timestamps, watermarks, and merge/upsert logic. Think ""how do I process only new/changed data efficiently?""4.​Set-based thinking: Coming from Python, you might be used to loops. SQL is set-based. Practice writing queries that transform entire datasets at once rather than row-by-row logic.5. ​Real-world scenarios: Go beyond LeetCode. Practice queries like: ​Detecting duplicate orders ​Calculating running totals/moving averages ​Handling NULL values and edge cases ​Transforming nested/JSON data​For Shopify specifically: They care about how you communicate your approach. Talk through your thinking: ""I’m using a CTE here for readability"" or ""This JOIN might be slow, but we could index X…""​Good luck!",vegusphyseek,2026-01-31 09:51:22,13,dataengineering,t3_1qrlhoj,False,

By that I mean if they list older technologies in their job positing or the company inherently keeps themselves ancient like Intel/IBM/some pharmaceutical companies/some government jobs/etc. This approach may not be for everyone but I applied to hundreds, if not thousands of jobs in a year.

o2kvrao,">What's the motivation to still pursue this field ?As somebody who went into this field from a different field, if you work in IT/programming, don't suck at it, and work for a decent company, GOOD LORD is it a sweet deal.Life as a chemist:* There is no such thing as remote work. You are on-site 100% of the time. I used to have to commute 1.5 hours one way if it was a quick journey. Made me give up all of my hobbies post work. Standard working day was around 12 hours (wake up at 6, get home at around 6). Yeah, I could have moved closer but I'm glad I didn't because it meant I'd have moved to bum fuck nowhere for a job which ended my contract during the pandemic* Labs are often in shitty locations. Good luck if you want to live near a city and have a reasonable commute time. Didn't pack a lunch? Budget 20 minutes of your lunch time getting to and from somewhere to get something to eat* People think lab work is a refined art where people stand around in pristine labs and discuss how the universe works. In reality, the labs are freezing cold in winter, swelteringly hot in summer, and poorly maintained. Half of me isn't surprised because if there is an explosion/fire, it's not a huge amount of damage cost.* No windows can be quite common in buildings. Somewhere I used to work, during winter there were days I'd see no natural light (get in before sun rise, sun sets at around 4 pm)* It's also a lot more physical than people give credit for. Lifting large/heavy vessels into/out of your fume cupboard as well as transporting large quantities of materials isn't easy on your back as you get older* I worked in organic synthesis where if you don't have a PhD in chemistry, it's incredibly hard to not only break into the field but succeed because you're talking about the vast majority of people have a PhD, thus use it as a stick to beat you with (quite fairly, tbh). I do not have a PhD and was usually the only person in the lab who didn't have a PhD* The work environment is a lot less forgiving than tech. You can't google and hit the right answer easily. You really have to know what you are asking the internet. Even then, the answers are likely not widely published. People are a lot smarter on average and a lot less willing to accept bullshit answers* Salaries are not remotely comparable although you do get a much better pension. For reference, I used the chemical companies used to pretty much double your contributions. I have never seen that figure in ITLife as a DE:* Work from home is an option. If you have to turn up, at least your office is likely somewhere accessible and temperature controlled* A much lower barrier to entry. The idea you ""need"" a Masters degree is, in my opinion, complete bollocks. DE education requirements are not standardised across the industry whereas chemistry absolutely is. It's not possible to get into chemistry without a chemistry degree, although you can definitely get into data without a CS degree* Difficulty isn't anywhere near as close. If I ruin a reaction in the lab, good luck getting that shit back. I guess it's like dropping a DB without a back up, although it's much easier to back something up than it is to make an extra X amount of material in case, I don't know, you drop your flask on the floor, somebody knocks it over etc. You live in a world of glass so breakages are inevitable* General working is a lot easier. Synthesis of a product can take a long time. A long one is multiple days if not weeks. You can turn something around quickly and have almost unlimited tries at it in DE* Stakes being lower means it's not as stressful although it does mean you get a lot more bozos because people are less careful. The introduction of AI has massively exposed who is and isn't a fraud (anybody who struggles without AI or ""has to"" lie on their CV is absolutely a fraud)* Zero manual labour. Much much lower chances of dying - I used to make novel pharmaceutical compounds which were definitely biologically active although since it has never been made or tested before (publicly), nobody has any idea how toxic the compound is. So, it could either do nothing or murder you on the spot. Fun fact: I once made something which was over 30 times more potent than fentanyl* Salaries are way higher on average. After 2-3 years of being in DE, I earnt double what I did as my final salary as a chemist after around 10 years in the industrySo what I'm saying is life is relative. If you have only ever worked in tech, then yeah, the grass will always seem greener.

o3hzkxd,"Did that move about 3 years ago, can share my 2 cents.Why I switched: I realized the parts of DE I enjoyed most were modeling data for analysts, arguing about metrics definitions, and making dashboards actually useful. I cared less about perfect infra and more about “are people making better decisions with this.” Analytics engineering was basically that full time.Day to day difference: as a DE I spent a lot of time on infra, pipelines, performance, random firefighting. As an AE I’m still writing SQL and some Python, but I’m way closer to the business. More time on dbt models, tests, documentation, semantic layers, and collaborating with PMs / analysts. Less Kafka / Spark / k8s, more “what does ‘active user’ actually mean and can we stop changing it every quarter.”Step up or step down: it’s more of a fork than a ladder. If you like infra and scale problems, AE will feel softer. If you like modeling, metrics, and being involved in product / strategy chats, it feels like a step up because your impact is easier to see. Comp for me stayed roughly the same, slightly higher later because I became the “metrics owner” and that’s valuable at product‑led companies.Branding / career path: I brand myself as “data platform + analytics” now. Titles I see after AE: senior AE, analytics lead, data product manager, head of data, sometimes even PM for data products. You become a good candidate for roles where you’re the bridge between pure engineering and pure analytics.Gotchas:You will write a lot of SQL and stakeholder‑friendly docs.You’ll spend more time in meetings explaining data than tuning clusters.If you hate ambiguity and politics around definitions, it can be frustrating.With 8 years as DE you’re probably overqualified on the tech side. The real question is whether you want to move closer to the business and be judged more on clarity, communication and “does this metric make sense” than on how elegant your pipeline is.

Most of them are trash tbf, but recrutiers won't take much time to scan your resume. Make sure it's easy to read. Make sure there is impressive stuff in there. Look at your CV and compare yourself with 1000 random people. Is there any way you can change something to make it better than your competitors?\- THEN work on the technical details.

So understand frameworks: Orchestration, Deployment, Quality Testing, Monitoring etc. You can learn those directly with Airflow, dbt etc. or even build it by yourself in Python. Cool project to show btw.\- At any seniority, people suck at SQL. At least for an Analytics Engineering role, this should be your best mastered skill. JOINs, GROUP BYs, Aggregations are the most basic skills. People failed so frequently on rolling averages, knowing when to use a window function and when not, how to filter by year or month, not knowing anything about how queries execute etc. I still can't believe I've rejected \~70% in a simple SQL round.

Understand what happens in every step. This is a usual dbt workflow, learn it by just moving some messy tables to create a final cool KPI.\- If you want to add a personal project: Have a URL, let me click it and let me be able to explore it and think ""cool"".

o3qseyz,"We do both. We make inline documentation and also we generate documentation for dbt models using LLM. In our case we use Cline or Claude Code. We have a specific workflow for each type of model that the LLM follows to generate the docs. Moreover, we instruct the LLM to produce the same structure of documentation for each type of model.For example, curated (mart/gold etc.) models are directed more for the end user and contain sections such as purpose, business use cases, metrics ect. So not too technical. Intermediate models ,i.e., models used to split up complex transformation logic are documented with the developers as an audience, so they are much more technical and basically explain what we are doing CTE by CTE.For most models #Business Logic is a section where we explain the specific business logic/rules implemented. The LLM infers these business logic by lopking both at the RAW query and inline comments. Also if it detects a business logic from a query, we instruct it to add short inline comments explaining it. So it goes both ways.Using LLM to generate documentation increases the doc coverage in our project and increases the uniformity of documentation structure across all models. In turn this documentation is then indeed used to power AI Agents for Data Discovery - think chatting with agents to discover which/where data is stored to answer specific request, so they don't answer the question, they just point the user to where they can probably find their answer. It may be also a documented exposure, not model per se. And eventually it could also power AI analytics, where they actually access a semantic/metrics layer or directly query the database based on all of the context.

Most commonly, this happens when there is a campaign where the target audience is brand new. I cannot tell you how many times I find myself caught in email chains with compliance and legal where their segmentation criteria requirements specify data points that the company does not even have and has no way of obtaining in a timely or reasonable way. Many times, I will point this out to my superiors who will just ignore me and leave me to figure it out on my own because they have no idea what to do. This literally happened to me last quarter. :zany_face: I work closely with the team that does operational comms, and it is similarly stressful because they do not always know what list criteria they will need or when. They often deal with Sudoku like puzzles where they have to build lists with pieces of information, from multiple applications and then find a method to validate the results.Even coordinating sends becomes challenging because of how dynamic the production process is. Multiple rounds of revisions means delayed approval which can push past the expected send date, causing sending conflicts that now have to be sorted out with multiple teams that often believe their message should be priority.2. Yes. “Everything is a fire.” :fire: Things break unexpectedly all the time, and we are constantly conducting an orchestra in front of a live audience. Marketing comes to you complaining of “bad” data, but keep in mind that often we are fielding complaints from our stakeholders, triggering the inquiry. (FWIW Typically, I only flag anomalies after multiple observations or complaints. I also do some initial investigating on my end, like reviewing audit and sync error logs to rule out the obvious.)Successfully capturing UTM parameters is kind of like walking a tightrope if you have a bloated tech stack and duplicate records. Yes, collection CAN be the issue, but I’m 15 years into a career as an IC in digital marketing now, and I mostly pull my hair out from poor data practices upstream in the CRM (e.g; users deleting emails and creating a new record, duplicates merged where UTMs aren’t preserved, poor field level security or outdated/inappropriate user permissions, etc.) I’ve had an experience just in the last few years where the internal IT team decided to pull Marketing’s access to the native UTM fields (after 8+ years of having access) because a newer and more senior product hire had this as a requirement. It broke all of the UTM tracking from the website and some other applications, and I had to spend a year arguing with them to get it fixed :face_with_rolling_eyes:The practices I see in Salesforce in the last 5 years truly feel like a major regression from the ways that I learned to manage data and technology early on in my career.

B connects each account code to the service, but then the aggregation has to be done at the reporting level (in this case, Tableau).

Biomedical + CS + interest in AWS is a really solid combo for any company doing healthcare / medtech / clinical analytics. You’re not “just another CS grad” and you should lean into that in your branding.Job search stuff:You’re not going to win by only applying through LinkedIn / Indeed. Use them to find roles, but assume most of your “wins” will come from:- Direct company career pages (especially mid‑sized boring‑sounding companies, not just the big names)- Alumni network from your undergrad and your MS program- Local meetups / online meetups (data engineering, cloud, healthcare analytics)On LinkedIn specifically:Search for “data engineer”, filter by Experience → Entry level / Associate, and also try “analytics engineer” and “data analyst” with SQL + Python + cloud. A lot of “data engineer” work is hiding under those titles and is more friendly to juniors.Then for roles you like:Check who works there as a data engineer / analytics engineer / dev on LinkedIn. Add them with a short note like:“Hey, saw you work on X at Y. I’m a biomedical eng + CS grad student getting into data engineering (SQL/Python/AWS, a few personal projects). Would love to ask 2–3 quick questions about how you got started there if you have time.”You’re not asking for a job, you’re asking for info. Some % of those chats naturally turn into referrals.Targeting-wise, with your background I’d look at:Health tech startups, EHR vendors, medical device companies, hospital systems, insurers, pharma / biotech. They all have messy data and love someone who actually understands the domain.Also, consider “bridge” roles:Data analyst, BI dev, “reporting engineer,” even some backend roles with a data flavor. If they let you work with SQL, warehouses, ETL, and AWS, that’s a path into a pure DE title later. First job title matters less than “I have 1–2 years of real data work on my resume.”Projects:Make 2–3 small but real projects that scream “I can do data engineering” and “I know healthcare”.Example: pull some public health dataset, build a basic pipeline:ingest → clean → store → query → simple dashboard.Put it on GitHub, write a 1‑page README that explains the problem, tech stack, and what you did. This is gold in interviews.If you want to play with realistic internal‑tool type stuff: spin up a small web UI on top of that data so someone non‑technical could view / edit it. Tools like uibakery / Retool / Appsmith are handy for this, because you can show “I know how to wire APIs + DB + UI together” without spending months learning frontend. That’s closer to what a lot of internal data teams actually do.Mindset part:The “no light at the end of the tunnel” feeling is super normal. Most people don’t talk about the 200 ignored applications, just the 1 offer. If you’re sending out apps into a void with no feedback, shift some of that time into:- Reaching out to humans- Tightening 1–2 standout projects- Practicing SQL + basic data modeling + simple dbt / Airflow patterns so you crush technical screensYou’re not incapable.

Furthermore, I just started learning React to learn the front-end of software development.AI tools like Copilot have dramatically increased my ability to learn AND to catch my own errors faster.Page not working? I can reason with Claude and say: “Here’s what I’m trying to do on lines 100-115 within this component. I’ve tried x, y, and z but it’s still not loading properly.”Then Claude will run its magic, offer me several solutions and most importantly explain *why* it gave those answers. Then the lightbulb goes off for me. It’s like having a teacher in my back pocket.I *could* spend 2 hours trying to solve a problem. But I like the happy medium approach: bang my head against the problem for 15-20 minutes and if I still can’t get past it, then I ask Copilot for help. It still gives me a chance to use my brain, yet I don’t spend all my time chasing down useless tutorials and outdated answers from 3 years ago.The key to learning with AI isn’t to just get the answer.

It helped me. ```When (and only when) the user is asking a technical / software-engineering-related question (coding, debugging, architecture, tooling, infra, performance, data, etc.), follow the Technical Coaching Policy below. For non-technical questions, respond normally.PRIMARY OBJECTIVE (highest priority)Maximise the user’s learning through their own thinking and decisions. Be a force multiplier for skill and clarity—never a replacement for reasoning. Success is defined by the user understanding and being able to do it themselves.OPERATING MODES (stateful; affects technical questions only)- COACH mode (default): You guide and scaffold; you do not deliver full solutions.- DIRECT mode: You may answer normally (including complete solutions/code).MODE SWITCH COMMANDS- Switch to DIRECT mode when the user’s most recent message contains: FORCE_ANSWER- Switch to COACH mode when the user’s most recent message contains: RESET_COACH- If both appear in the same message, the command that appears last (latest position in the message text) wins.- Treat these as literal, case-sensitive substrings.- When a mode switch happens, do NOT require the user to restate their question. Proceed to answer the same message in the newly selected mode (ignoring the command text as part of the “question”).SCOPE: WHAT TO COACH VS WHAT TO ANSWER DIRECTLY (in COACH mode)- Coaching rules apply to: debugging, implementation, architecture, system design, algorithm choice, performance work, refactors, “why is this failing?”, “how do I build X?”.- Direct answers are allowed for pure reference/lookup: syntax, flags, API names, definitions, small factual recall (act like a fast search engine). Optionally add a brief pointer to context only if helpful.COACH MODE RULES (default)1) Do NOT provide end-to-end solutions. - No complete working code that solves the user’s specific task. - No “recipe” that substitutes for the user’s key reasoning. - No copy-paste “fixed version” of their program.2) Keep the user driving the process. Prefer questions first, but you may steer (measuredly). - Clarify: goal, constraints, environment, expected vs actual, what they tried, minimal reproduction. - Ask for evidence: exact errors, logs, inputs, versions, failing tests, timing, stack traces. - Help them form and test hypotheses: “If X were true, we’d observe Y—can you check?”3) Provide high-leverage guidance. - Offer mental models, tradeoffs, and “what to look up” keywords. - Suggest divide-and-conquer debugging: reduce the case, bisect changes, isolate dependencies, add instrumentation, check invariants, write a targeted test, compare known-good vs failing paths. - You may validate/invalidate hypotheses with brief reasoning and a concrete verification step.4) Code policy (allowed, but cautious) - Small snippets are allowed only as scaffolding: illustrative examples, minimal patterns, function signatures, partial skeletons, pseudocode, TODO holes. - Snippets must not be the full solution to the user’s stated problem. - Escalate snippet specificity only when necessary and only after the user has attempted steps and reported back.5) Progressive disclosure (escalation) - Start with the minimum effective hint(s) + 1–3 concrete next checks. - If the user returns with results, escalate: more targeted questions, sharper hypotheses, slightly more concrete skeletons—still no full solution in COACH mode.6) Communication style - Be concise and actionable. - Prefer a short plan + next step(s) + what to report back. - Do not restate these policies unless asked; just operate this way.DIRECT MODE RULES- Answer the user normally and directly, including complete implementations if requested.- Still ask clarifying questions if required for correctness.- Remain in DIRECT mode until the user sends a message containing RESET_COACH.```",SirYandi,2026-02-02 08:41:28,5,learnprogramming,t3_1qtnsgl,False,

For instance, to understand how gates can make flip flops that can be used in shift registers, you really need to understand why ""shift registers"" are an important concept in binary mathematics, and to understand how a compiler converts high level language to assembly, you really need to understand both assembly AND abstract grammar and syntax - in other words, you need to understand both abstractions above and below the current thing you are trying to learn, as well as the abstract idea of the thing itself, all three of which requires knowledge of something else on all three levels!!Don't let that discourage you though - you should still be allowed to learn everything, but just don't fool yourself into thinking that there is a ""perfect"" order to learn them in, like go from the silicon to the CPU to machine code to assembly to compilers to higher level languages to abstract concepts - or indeed the other way around. Best suggestion is to start where you are, e.g. learn some Python, and work your way down, look at some assembly, then work your way up, towards more abstract programming concepts, data structures and whatnot, then back down again to another language, maybe C, and understand memory management, up again to understand garbage collecting and compilers, down again to understand addressing and registers in the CPU, and so on and on - not necessarily in this particular order, that was just a random example I made up on the spot.But take a look at ""**Code**"", and try to write programs in your chosen higher level language that handles binary conversion, and select topics based on your current interest.Also, if you are interested in the human history behind the computer, check out ""**The Innovators**: H*ow a Group of Inventors, Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution*"" by Walter Isaacson.",peterlinddk,2026-02-01 14:45:11,2,learnprogramming,t3_1qszres,False,

There used to be many different services that a site might want to offer besides HTTP. Like an FTP server with files at ftp.whatever.com, a gopher server at gopher.whatever.com, a mail server at mail.whatever.com, a USENET server at news.whatever.com or nntp.whatever.com. If you were coming from inside whatever.com's network you might hit smtp.whatever.com to send mail and imap.whatever.com to retrieve yours. Back in the day these would likely have actually been different physical computers. And in that world, www.whatever.com was just another service - ""www"" for ""World-Wide Web"".But it did not take long for the Web to take over the Internet, after which pretty much everything else took a back seat to it. The web was everyone's ""front door"", so they wanted to make it as easy as possible to get to. For that reason, most companies arranged for their top-level domain (""TLD""), when looked up all by itself, to point to their web server's IP address. That way you could just type `whatever.com` into your browser to get there. (Later browsers would add this as a fallback behavior; if you enter 'whatever.com' and it can't find an IP address for that, it will give 'www.whatever.com' a try. But originally it was up to the site owners to make that work.)Rather than just duplicating the web server's IP address record, which could lead to forgetting to change both in the future, the equivalence is usually accomplished by making the ""www"" subdomain an _alias_ for the TLD. (Not the other way around, because the root of a domain can't be an alias for technical reasons.) In the DNS database, the value associated with an alias record is the ""canonical name"" that it is an alias _for_, called a CNAME for short; for that reason, they're also called CNAME records, and sometimes aliases are called CNAMEs, even though that's sort of the opposite of what it means. Anyway, your example is one of those: $ dig +noall +answer www.9gag.com a www.9gag.com. 300 IN CNAME 9gag.com.What that means is that when a computer goes to look up the IP address of ""www.9gag.com"", it gets an answer back saying ""use the address of 9gag.com"". So it has to turn around and look up ""9gag.com"" to get the actual IP address. (Fortunately for the sake of net traffic reduction, when your computer looks it up, your ISP's nameserver has likely already done that for you and just returns both the CNAME and the IP addresses - A records for IPv4, AAAA records for IPv6 - in response to the original query.)",zeekar,2026-02-03 19:46:37,8,learnprogramming,t3_1qus7ht,False,

Programming is a never ending exercise in abstraction. To do the work, you only need to worry about the one piece that you’re working on at any moment. If you’re writing a function that computes a value based on its parameters, you don’t care where those parameters came from. If you’re calling another function, you don’t need to worry about how it does what it does — you only care about *what* it does (and sometimes how long it takes).

But there also was more time and less competition.Now, fast is key. Which is completely wrong.

They *give* the code and only expect the learner to type it in - which is the totally wrong approach to learning. This is not learning.Worst tutorials are *""How to build X in language Y""* tutorials. They are plain useless. You, as the learner will not learn anything from them, not even the skill to build X in language Y on your own. All you will learn is to copy the code.About *proper usage* of tutorials: if you really go through a tutorial (not as a complete and utter beginner - as such, you should take a *course*), try to predict the code. Once the task following is explained, stop the tutorial and try to write the code on your own. Try a good amount of time and make different attempts if your first fails. Then, once you have a solution, or can't think of any other way, continue with the tutorial and compare - this way you train *your thinking* (which is far more important than your *coding*) and the coding plus, you get the final code to maybe learn the one or other thing from.I still think that the best approach to learning is first a solid *course* and then (and along with the course) program, program, program, program.

They should be identifying a field and learn the languages and tools used in that field.If you just learn a random language, you could be stuck in tutorial hell because once you are done learning that random language you may well find that nobody actually uses that language in the field you are interested in.e.g. you are advised to learn Pascal in response to the incorrect question because of its clarity and simplicity. Then you want to work in robotics. Sorry, go back and learn C/C++.## watching/reading but not doingA common problem I see is people complaining that they slogged through the entire series, but then can't do anything.That is because they slogged through the series and everything that went in one ear, got pushed right out the other side.People need to regularly press pause on the tutorial (or bookmark the book) and try out what they have seen. Experiment with it. Try to get it to do something else. For example, if taught how to create a loop that counts from 1 to 10, try to make it so that it goes from 10 to 1.## AIThis will be triggering for some - especially the AI propaganda bots. But AI is a double edged sword.If used correctly, to search, consolidate or explain it can be a useful tool.But if it is used to generate code - especially on anything more than an occasional basis then the risk is the same as my previous ""... not doing"" point.

It doesn't work and I don't know how to fix it."".

This is very important to develop independently, breaking down complex problems into steps computers understand is arguably what programming *is*.Library gaps refer to not knowing specific tools that your language or libraries provide you. You mostly pick these up over time and it's not a big deal to look them up.For example, if you want to convert a string to lowercase, algorithmic thinking tells you that you can iterate through the string, convert each letter (with e.g. ascii code math), and build a new string. You should conceptually be able to write that code in your head in your preferred language, even if you don't type it out. Library knowledge tells you ""in python, you can do string.lower().""Stackoverflow (and docs) is good for learning library knowledge. As you build more library knowledge in a language, it translates to having an easier time thinking algorithmically in that language.",etoastie,2026-02-04 08:27:13,15,learnprogramming,t3_1qviwo1,False,

o3l8sjs,"There are tons of ways to learn and everyone has different starting points.If you are brand new, looking at code and figuring out how it interacts with other code is really great at forming the understanding of how data points are processed and how different data types interact. This will build familiarity, but won't build problem solving skills.Once you have the gist of how and why some functions work, start learning the terminology. This is arguably one of the stronger skills you will need in the age of AI. Knowing exactly what to look for or how to phrase the parts you are stuck on will help immensely.Problem solving skills are the top priority skills for all programmers. The ONLY way to build this is with practice. Projects are great ways to practice breaking down big problems into tiny problems. If you need to practice tiny problems, chug away at LeetCode, HackerRank, or other platforms that can present a problem to you and give you instant feedback on if your solution is acceptable.All projects/apps/features boild down to this line of thinking: ""how do I break this problem down into chunks that I can work with?""I generally have a rough idea of what the end-project looks like, then I split that project into milestones, then I keep splitting each milestone into smaller parts until I find a place to start building out everything within the milestone. If your milestones are independent of one another, you can rotate which parts of the project to do if you get stuck and don't want to burn out. If one milestone depends on another, you gotta finish all of the first one before you can work on the second one.All project structures will be different. There are countless ways to solve most problems once they are larger. Usually the ""right"" way to solve something either won't exist or won't be evident until after you have tried a bunch of different things. The goal is to get your project to a working point, and to keep tabs of any new skills learned along the way.Edit to add: you will always be looking stuff up. There is far too much technical documentation for anyone to fully memorize. If you need something done quick, look for shortcuts or similar completed projects.

o3njvhi,"Learning how to code is more like learning how to fit a jigsaw puzzle together or how to make a square plug fit in a round hole. Programming language doesn't matter.It is more problem solving than actually writing code. My first professional programming job was in 1983. Today after I figure how or what the structure of the program should be, I sit down and just type. Most times I don't think about the code and somehow like magic, my fingers just type away. But I will tell you this, I learned typing in high school in 1978, not because I knew I was going to use it one day, but because I was 1 guy in a classroom with 29 other girls for an hour every day. It somehow just worked out that I was going to need it and can now type words out as fast as someone can talk. Learning computer language after computer language can also be really difficult. But what amazed me is the structured process of learning another spoken language. Classes always start with ""Who, What, When, Where, Why and How"". With those 6 spoken words, learning those 6 words in another spoken language and building on those, makes learning another spoken language so much easier.I'm fluent in Spanish, and Portuguese as Portuguese is basically Spanish with some French mixed in. I can survive speaking German on the basic level and I know enough Mandarin to order in a restaurant. All computer languages have the same basics as spoken languages. If, do, while, loop, for, next, with a majority of languages also having a switch statement or something similar. If you can get those procedures down, learning another computer language becomes so much more easier. It also makes fitting a square plug in a round hole so much more easier in a different computer language you may not be familiar with.So, don't spend that much time concentrating on the actual computer language and concentrate on problem solving to use the language you are currently working with.And if anyone really wants to know, when I sleep at night I dream in C#.",HobbesArchive,2026-02-05 03:18:44,2,learnprogramming,t3_1qviwo1,False,

For example, can you write a loop in your language that prints every item in an array? (Without looking for help, that is). In general you should be able to go from a detailed text description of an algorithm to the code without using stackoverflow. Pros use SO and AI, but we don't use that code verbatim without fully understanding how the code works. And if we understand the algorithm, coding it in the language of choice should be straightforward.My suggestion is to look for help in a language substantially different from the one you work in.

Don’t be afraid to look things up online if allowed. I’d expect you to use the Python docs You’ll be sharing your screen so make sure you don’t have anything inappropriate open / nsfw desktop wallpaper etcIf you’re given a coding task mock out what you plan to do in pseudo code first. Throw some empty functions in etc. just do what you need to outline the problem and what you’re going to build so it’s clear to youIf they give you a task which has multiple parts get one working then the next. Don’t try do everything all at once. I’d rather see a candidate get 2/3 problems solved and miss one than have 80% of all 3 and nothing working. Say to yourself make it work then make it better. And say to them that’s what you’re doing. If you have a short amount of time prioritise what you have to do and talk about the stuff you would do. Like you won’t have time to write perfect error handling or unit tests but say where you would add them and why. The biggest thing to remember. Interviewers usually aren’t assholes.

o3dsomh,"The nature of Undefined Behavior is that the compiler - most of the time, can't prove an error; therefore, the spec says it's up to you personally to make sure the code is correct. The BEST we can do is SOMETIMES detect SOME cases of UB and emit a warning.There's an insidious nature to UB - no one can define it. Signed integer overflow is often well defined on hardware, that doesn't mean the C++ spec or the compiler gets to defer to the hardware. It's still undefined behavior. In fact, UB allows a compiler to optimize very aggressively. If, for example, you overflowed, you cannot reliably detect you've overflowed. You might think hey - just see if an increment of a positive results in a negative. But the compiler KNOWS overflow ""cannot"" happen, so it can correctly optimize the ""obviously"" impossible check out, and code paths that presume overflow didn't happen get a negative value anyway.Thus is the nature of UB. You're not going to win against the compiler's CORRECT assumptions that you're NOT going to fuck around with UB. And you don't know how the compiler is going to act upon those assumptions at any given time. Believe it or not, compilation itself is not inherently deterministic.Further, you may not even get consistent behaviors between program runs, or even while the program is running. And once UB has been evaluated at runtime, you cannot rely on what the program is going to do afterward.UB is to be respected. Your x64 or Apple M may be robust, but UB is what bricks a Nintendo DS, most famously when glitch hacking Pokemon or Zelda; you end up accessing an invalid bit pattern that fries some circuits in the ARM5 core.A lot of engineers are incorrectly dismissive of UB.

Having the bulk of your functions be side-effect free2. Using immutable data structures (e.g. don't modify your dicts/lists/dataclasses after they're created)...would be a good fit for the more pipeline-oriented nature of your task. You have data you're slicing and dicing, and want some reasonable assurances that each 'transform' or 'analysis' function you have in your script is self-contained and bug-free. Having a clean divide between IO code vs business logic and keeping mutation to a minimum are two good ways of helping you do this.The OOP paradigm is usually more useful when it's important you maintain certain 'invariants' around data: things like 'my data structure must always respect this property, no matter how it's modified' or 'all interactions with this particular 3rd party API must include these magic headers'. If you have a lot of these fiddly rules to manage, it can often be convenient to create a class that wraps around your data and presents a cleaner interface to the outside world.But I think this sort of need is rare in data-slicing or 'pipeline' style programs.Note that this sort of decision-making has nothing to do if you're writing a script or not. I've written short 100-line scripts that ended up making heavy use of OOP, and longer 5k-10k LOC production-ready services that used it very sparingly. My ultimate goal is to make the code as obviously correct as possible (which in turn makes it both easy to understand and modify). Sometimes objects can help with this, other times they won't.That is, OOP is not the same thing as 'clean code'. OOP is a _technique_ that can _help_ you write clean code -- but (a) it's not the only technique for doing so and (b) it's not a technique that'll be applicable 100% of the time.w.r.t. SWE best practices, I would look into:1. Writing tests and perhaps even a CI/CD pipeline for your scripts, starting with the more business critical / frequently run and modified ones. If people are actively making business decisions based on some of your analysis, you'd want reasonable confidence it indeeds behaves as expected. 2. Creating and popularizing a helper library that streamlines common operations. The goal here is to speed up the time it takes to author a new pipeline.I don't know anything about your company, but I'd imagine both correctness and speed-of-delivery are two factors that matter most to your team and your bosses.

You will probably get more targeted answers in data engineering or data science subreddits.For starters, I would try using something that can translate between notebooks and .py files like jupytext. Would make source control and other checks a lot easier.Based on what you have said, traditional unit tests are often difficult to apply here and tend to provide less value in data workflows than people expect. I would focus more on testing the output instead. Things like row counts, nulls, ranges, schema changes, distribution shifts, and data freshness usually catch issues much earlier.A lot of the unit test advice you are getting is common in app and web development, where the failure modes are different. In data, things usually break because the shape or semantics of the data change, not because someone touched the code.As far as OOP is concerned, you are less likely to run into it in many data jobs. It becomes important when dealing with graphs or hierarchies. Otherwise it is mostly useful for providing structure.Generally, anywhere you are passing a lot of variables to a function or manipulating large dicts, you will probably want to turn those into a dataclass. For external boundaries like configs, inputs, or outputs, use pydantic. Use type hints everywhere, and use a linter and code formatter as well.

Oop just means to group together data as objects with functions for those objects (originally without state, but today state is the center of oop -> state is probably the biggest cause of bugs, given that you test your code)Declarative programming is functional programming, reactive programming or logic programming. All similar, but for fp: you describe a function with other functions, to do that, you write functions that create functions and take functions as parameters, there is no state and a function only does one thing with one parameter… for example in procedural programming adding 2 numbers is done with a function like this: add = (a,b) => a+b Functional programming is a bit different, you have a function returning a function: add = a => b => a+b So, looks a bit unnecessary at first, but you can use functions to build functions… you can do: inc = add (1), while procedural would need a inc (a) => a+1. Increasing the items in a list is also easy: newList = oldList.map(add(1)), in procedural, you would loop over the list, getting every item, adding 1 and then pushing it in a new list. And oop would have a class inheriting from list, then have some build method that then changes the internal state to transform itself.

Self-teaching + building a mental model _does_ indeed require non-trivial mental effort.One tip: When I need to read through particularly gnarly code, I like to keep notes in a separate text file or doc.I typically structure this in a 'question -> answer' kind of way, where I create a separate section for each open question or ""line of investigation"" I have. Maybe I'll also create a separate section for quick links, TODOs, snippets of cli commands to run, etc.I find having this sort of structure makes it much easier for me to stay focused, especially in cases where I feel too overwhelmed trying to mentally remember and keep track of everything.> I wonder if that is something that gets better after some time.It will -- as you get more familiar with the code, you'll have to spend less and less time digging, simply by virtue of you already being familiar with more aspects of the codebase.Even longer term, it'll get easier once you've worked on enough systems to start seeing similarities and echos. For example, if you've spend a fair amount of time working with backend and cloud infra, new codebases in the same domain will start feeling vaguely similar. There are only so many ways of reasonably structuring code after all.I'll take time for both types of familiarity/experience to grow though: it's totally expected/normal to feel a bit lost as an intern or new hire.> This is my first in person internship, so I don't know if it is normal to just stand up and walk for 5 minutes.

If you're working on a project with other people, it probably makes sense to talk to those people and agree on how to format your commit messages. For example, [""Conventional Commits""](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is one example of a consistent way to format your commit messages. But for a solo project, it really doesn't matter at all whether you stick rigidly to something like this.As far as the *types* of information you should be putting in your commit messages: it should be enough to explain both what you changed and why you changed it, to a level of detail that you find sufficient. Commit messages are a form of documentation, and there's no one ""right"" level of detail for your documentation. It depends on how much time you're willing to spend on it.If you want some inspiration, you can take a look at the Linux, which generally has very detailed commit messages. Often the messages are much longer than the corresponding code changes. A Linux kernel PR won't be accepted if the maintainers don't think the commit message is clear enough, even if the code itself is fine.For instance, [this recent commit](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/76ed27608f7dd235b727ebbb12163438c2fbb617) has 31 lines of text (plus footers) to describe a 13-line code change. The first line contains just the most crucial details: the change affects performance monitoring (""perf"") in the scheduler (""sched"") subsystem, and it fixes a potential crash. The rest of the message goes into detail about exactly why the problem is happening and how it was fixed.Again, you probably don't need to go into nearly that level of detail for *all* your commits, especially if you're working on a project that's less critical than the Linux kernel. But while you're writing code, you should be thinking about how you would explain what you're doing to another programmer. And then you can decide how much of that explanation you want to put into the commit message.----Note also that deciding how to *describe* your commits goes hand-in-hand with deciding *what* changes to include in each commit. In the example I gave, it's straightforward to describe the commit's purpose because it's a very small, self-contained change. If the commit included other bug fixes at the same time, it would be a lot harder to write a good description.You might think that carefully breaking up your changes into multiple commits is just creating more work, but if you do it properly, it can make things easier for you in the long run.",teraflop,2026-02-02 01:44:57,5,learnprogramming,t3_1qth1ff,False,

If I were interviewing a brand new engineer, I'd probably throw them a few language specific questions just to see if they actually know what they're talking about or if they're just throwing out buzzwords (what's the difference between a List and a Set? Why use a TreeMap over a HashMap?). I might ask how they would implement a multithreaded solution and what problems can arise from multithreading and how they'd solve those problems. I would expect questions on REST API development (maybe GraphQL, but honestly, I've yet to see a valid use case for that). I'd definitely expect questions on unit testing. Why would I not expect too many low level questions? That stuff is already implemented in various libraries and APIs or is well documented and available online or through an AI prompt.

o3h4cl1,"Five months is actually a very reasonable timeline if you stay structured and avoid jumping between resources.First, do not overthink the language choice. Java and Python are both fine for interviews. Pick the one you feel more comfortable writing quickly. Interview performance is mostly about problem solving clarity, not language difficulty.The bigger mistake beginners make is trying to learn DSA and grind random problems at the same time. That usually leads to frustration because you recognize solutions when you see them but cannot reproduce them later.A simple structure that works well is learning one pattern at a time. Study the core idea, solve a few easy and medium problems, then come back later and try to rebuild the solution from memory. That last step is where most actual learning happens.If you are transitioning from a service company, consistency matters more than speed. Two focused hours daily with review and recall usually beats long random grinding sessions.I built a small platform called [algodrill.io](http://algodrill.io) after mentoring people making this same transition. It focuses specifically on helping you rebuild solutions from memory instead of just recognizing them. It might help if recall and retention are the parts you struggle with, but the main thing is staying structured and consistent regardless of resource.Five months is enough if you avoid resource hopping and focus on depth over volume.",purplecow9000,2026-02-04 04:32:58,2,learnprogramming,t3_1quz22h,False,
o3ep78h,"Language doesn't matter that much. It can make a big difference on how you solve these, but just pick whatever language is actually relevant to the kinds of jobs are interested in, so you're not spreading yourself thin for no good reason.I don't have an opinion on the resources you mentioned. What they're mainly good for is narrowing, say, the entire leetcode problem set down to a _much_ smaller subset that gives you a focused sampling of the major problem types. There are more problems on leetcode.com than a sane person has time for or need for, and there's a lot of overlap between many leetcode problems, so you want to avoid aimlessly meandering there and treating leetcode.com as the roadmap. * Start with easy problems only. * Gradually build up your toolkit of data structures so you learn when to apply certain data structures to which kinds of situations, and exposure to issues that can arise when writing code (off-by-one, index or boundary issues, logic errors, proper handling of numbers, concurrent modification issues, reference vs value, mutability issues, etc.)* Some ""easy"" problems may seem hard, and it may not be your fault * IIRC some leetcode problems were mislabeled, and may still be? Those sites that give you a more curated list might help avoid this issue? Anyway, I'd avoid picking random problems directly from leetcode.com itself.* Work on problems one at a time, give them a fair shot, but don't waste inordinate amounts of time being stuck. * Force yourself to think and use the tools you can recall. If you can't solve a problem in a reasonable time because you're simply missing the tools needed to solve it, then just look up and study well-written, non-code-golfed solutions, understand the key pieces, and move on. And plan to revisit those problems later on (put them at the back of your problem queue). Over time your recall of the problem -> solution mappings will strengthen.* Always be putting your solution (and test cases) in its own file that you can _run_ on your machine. * e.g. `node leetcode1-twosum.js`. You can also use a debugger, e.g. `node --inspect-brk leetcode1-twosum.js` when you run into problems.* Try not to see DSA as an isolated thing. * The main thing it boils down to is picking the right data structure(s) that suit the problem and help you meet the requirements, whatever they are. * A hard part is these problems can feel contrived and disconnected, which may be true, or may be an illusion - it depends. There's no one way to feel about it. I'm still deeply affected by having learned the ""text justification"" DP problem, and nobody can take from me. * Try to come to your own conclusions about the need/value of studying DSA problems based on the kinds of companies you're interested in. Feeling bad about this interview style is a common feeling, but not necessarily a useful feeling, depending on what you're after.* Timebox your DSA study so that you can make time for other things * Mostly to make sure you're spending time working on actual projects, so you're slowly getting exposure there. * Personal projects can give you freedom to try things that may be difficult to justify trying at work, and which can have very high learning/growth value. * Some experience solving DSA problems can benefit your implementations a bit, but won't help you learn how to design systems. So they can be complementary.For advice moving from a service-oriented to a product company...* if your current job has lots of greenfield projects with a short lifecycle, take advantage of that as a catalyst for growth, and as freedom to try slightly different approaches and to learn from past mistakes in code design. * Once you move to a product company, that can be less common. It can still happen, e.g. starting new products, or somewhat isolated subprojects or tools, etc. that serve the overall product in whatever way. But a lot of your time will be spent on things you may not be able to change easily.* Don't overly aggrandize product companies and don't belittle yourself and the time you're spending right now. * Have a mentality that your time right now is preparation for what's to come.* In your current job, try to be curious and thinking about your own growth. * If you have some decision-making power over which technologies or approaches are used, try to carve out a little space for yourself to grow, whatever that means. Try to keep it low-risk (don't put projects at risk due to making wild choices, but try to take whatever liberties you can that help you move in the direction of writing better code and making better overall system design choices that meet the requirements of the project). * If you don't have that power yet, then try to keep growing your skills and becoming so good that companies feel compelled to put you in that position and let you take the lead on things.* Prep for interviews, but don't wait too long to jump into the fray. * Usually interviews don't give good (or any) direct feedback, but ideally you have a rough sense of what you did well or not so well, and figure out what to work on. Dwelling on the asymmetry of the interview process won't help you, it is what it is.* Don't be too surprised when interviews don't go well * Just move right along to the next one, and don't get discouraged by the process. * Try to glean whatever you can, and cross-reference how you did with how others do, e.g. watch videos of mock interviews if useful. See what they do well and think about what you didn't do as well.* Ask your interviewers directly what you can do better!!! * Don't leave this up to HR to do (they won't). * Your fellow programmers _might_ be willing to say _something_ when asked directly at the very end. Don't be surprised if some cop out of this, but not all will. Either way, it's better than not asking and then getting absolutely 0 on the tail end.* Make sure to express interest in the company and product/problem domain. * When the interview ends with Q&A, be sure to have at least a couple questions about the team and/or company!! It can tip the scales in your favor a bit.* Don't automatically assume rejections are because you're bad. * Sometimes the company just has to pick between multiple people, and you may have been good but not _as_ good as somebody else. Well, what happens if that person gets hit by a bus, or quits, or whatever. Leave things on as good of a note as you can, you never know when a connection reaches out again, and luck may have it that you're still looking when they do.",SoSpongyAndBruised,2026-02-03 20:42:40,1,learnprogramming,t3_1quz22h,False,

o3jpfx2,"With an EE background, your career path matters more than the language itself. Here's the practical breakdown: If you want to stay close to hardware (embedded systems, robotics, IoT, firmware) - start with C. It maps directly to how you already think about registers, memory, and hardware. Arduino uses C++ technically, but in a very C-like way. The embedded industry still runs on C and will for decades. Companies like Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and automotive firms want C + understanding of hardware, which is exactly your combo. If you want to pivot toward software engineering at a tech company - C++ is the better resume play. It's used heavily in game engines, high-frequency trading, operating systems, and performance-critical applications. But honestly? For most software engineering roles at tech companies, Python (which you already know) plus a web language would get you further than either C or C++. The real answer nobody's telling you: your EE degree + programming is a rare and valuable combination. Don't think of it as ""learning to code from scratch."" Companies building physical products with software components (robotics, autonomous vehicles, medical devices, consumer electronics) specifically seek people who understand both sides. That's a much less crowded job market than pure software dev. Start with C on Arduino since you're excited about it. Motivation beats optimization every time when you're learning.

Find all the valid prefixes from the string before you check if the prefixes are valid. That way you don’t have to loop through the string every time you check a prefix. You only have to loop through it once.If string is “abc” then all valid prefixes are (“a”, “ab”). Then you loop through the prefixes list checking to see if the string is in the set. Checking the set is O(1) so it’s fast and looping through the potential prefixes list is o(n).

Iterate from 1 instead.2. `findminlength` could be better renamed to `findShortestStringLength`.3. Use for loop in `findminlength`.4. Assuming that this is Java, don't concatenate a lot of small strings. Strings are immutable in Java, so you are creating a copy every time you do `string0 += string1`. Use a `StringBuilder` instead.5. Don't write comments like ""this loop iterates over indices of `strings`"", it is useless, you can get that information by looking at the code itself. But you can explain why you start at 1, not 0.6. In the else branch, you set `smallestLenght` to `zwischenergebniss.length()`, which will cause the loop to break, because `zwischenergebniss` has length of `i + 1` at that point. Insert `break` there to make it explicit and remove the `zwischenergebniss = """"`, because it is reset on the next iteration a second time.7. `zwischenergebniss` can be removed and replaced by `result`.8. You shouldn't modify the argument passed to the string. Nothing about the function indicates that the function has side effects, it should be pure.

Put spaces between `)` and `{` on while loops and body of a function. Choose whether you want to put spaces after/before `=` or not. Stuff like thatIf I understand your solution correctly, the inner loop can be simplified by a lot. You need to count how many characters match and then replace `smallestLength` by that value.

o2q9fj7,"Depends on the engine.Firstly: If you've never programmed before, learn that before touching a game engine. At the very least, learn1. What variables are (ints, floats, booleans, and strings)2. What functions/methods are (bonus points if you can tell me the difference)3. What for-loops and while-loops are4. What objects are5. What data structures (at least: Arrays, Lists, Dictionaries, Stacks and Queues) are.After that, then you can go to the game engine.If you mean the whole ""getting used to your environment"" - start by following a short game tutorial, and then adding functionality to it (make flappybird, then add a coin collecting mechanic - or extra life pickups). This will teach you where things are, and how to get there. When following the tutorial, don't follow line by line, but section by section. Watch for a few minutes, and then repeat it on your own trying not to reference the video. This will teach you how to maneuver.After you understand the 5 basic windows most editors contain (scene view, game view, project files, hierarchy/scene tree, and the inspector), and you've followed maybe 3 basic tutorials, move onto making simple games on your own. [I recommend The 20 Games Challenge](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=82257b40e0c0ad322422c1a739ab848cd655250585883297a44bb103ee62ed7aJmltdHM9MTc2OTczMTIwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=2c6d9a75-b7b3-6591-338f-8c84b639640d&psq=the+20+game+challeng&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly8yMF9nYW1lc19jaGFsbGVuZ2UuZ2l0bGFiLmlvL2NoYWxsZW5nZS8) \- it's an amazing teaching tool simply due how it encourages repetition.Between the games you make, try creating some basic systems - like an inventory, or a healthbar. Small things just to learn how to abstract these tools away. Better yet, make them on their own, and reuse them in some projects to learn how to make things modular.As for healthy habits:* In general, you don't start a project in editor, you start with the notepad/whiteboard: Plan. Think about what you want to accomplish, and quantify it. If it ain't quantifiable, explain it as a story that gives quantifiable metrics. We call these Functional & Non-functional/Quality Requirements. Define and prioritize those first. Once you know exactly what it is you want to make, start to break that thing down into identifiable entities, their components, and their relationships to everything else. Think about how the game works, and the major parts of it.* Look up SOLID programming principles, and Object Oriented Design Patterns. They are incredibly helpful in game dev, because they teach you how to arrange ideas in a way that's typically useful for simulations like games* When in doubt about how certain things work, read the docs. They are dense, but they're by far the most useful resource at your disposal.* Follow a consistent coding style. Your code should look the same regardless of where it is - this makes it easier to parse over later.

What do you need for that, break it down to the individual components of your game. Two independently moving paddles, a ball that moves and bounces around, and a pair of scoring zones, and a score display for each player.1. So create your scene, stick in a paddle, hook in keyboard controls so that it can move.2. Create a scene, stick in a ball and give it initial momentum so it moves in a direction, hook in the scoring zone and make the ball score if it enters the scoring zone, keep track of the score, display the score3. So create a scene, stick in a ball and a paddle and make the ball bounce off the paddle if it is hit.4. Create a scene that combines all of the above into one, and you have your game.The advantage of this approach is that those first three items also give you your tests cases for your game. If you make a change to the game, you can see if you broke something in regards to the gameplay.Look at the information about the various Game Jams to practice.

Assuming everything else in the system is written correctly, these bad hashing functions will impact efficiency but not correctness.Comparing two objects for pointer equality is generally very cheap, and this is what `==` does in most languages. “Pointer equality” means that the objects are in identical memory locations (whether on the machine or on a VM; the details are complicated but not relevant right now.) This means the objects are really and truly “the same”; if you mutate one, the other will be mutated as well, because they’re the same object.Comparing two object’s hash codes is frequently cheap, but not as cheap as pointer equality, because hash codes are often highly optimized and frequently cacheable. If the compiler/runtime knows that the object hasn’t changed since the last time you’ve computed its hash, it can choose to reuse the result of the last hashing operation instead of running it again.Comparing two objects for value equality can be expensive. “Value equality” means that the objects are conceptually the same. For nested objects, this generally means walking the whole object graph and comparing each piece of data in both objects to each other. For small objects this is cheap, for big objects it might not be. Value equality is a conceptually stronger guarantee than pointer equality, because it tells you that two objects “mean” the same thing, even if they were constructed at different locations. However, this can be fragile in the presence of mutability, because if you mutate one of the objects they might stop being equal.If you want to check whether two objects have value equality, usually you do this:1. Check whether the objects have pointer equality. If they do, the objects are equal and you’re done. Pointer equality implies value equality. 2. Check whether the objects have hash code equality. If they don’t, then they are unequal, and you’re done. Hash code inequality implies value inequality. 3. As a last resort, check whether the objects have value equality. Hash codes are especially necessary as a performance optimization when using objects in collections which have limitations around item equality. `Set` and `Map`/`Dictionary` are the main ones which come to mind. In a set you don’t want there to be multiple copies of objects which are equal to each other, and in a dictionary you don’t want to add duplicate keys. In both of these situations you’re not just comparing two objects for equality, you’re comparing one object to a whole bunch of objects and seeing if it’s equal to any of them. In a big collection, this would get more expensive as the collection gets bigger. Without hash codes, adding N items to a set is an O(N^2) operation. So the way these data structures are usually implemented is by using “buckets” of items which have hash codes in a given range. When you want to add an object, the data structure computes its hash code, then finds the bucket which it belongs to (an `O(M)` operation, where `M` is the number of buckets, or in some cases `O(1)`, depending on the implementation). Then, if there’s already items in the bucket, the object being added is compared to every item in that bucket until an equal object is found. (`O(N)`, for a much smaller `N` than before). All in all this is asymptotically much, much faster.Of course, as I alluded to earlier, mutability messes this whole thing up. If you mutate an object in a way that would change its hash code then the algorithm used by the data structure will no longer perform correctly and it will be left in an invalid state.Hopefully this helps.

It is absolutely normal that your code will differ from the model solutions.Yet, as an experienced programmer, I can tell, that I'd solve things differently and even more efficiently than the model solution, but that's owing to the fact that I'm more advanced than the course at the point of the exercises. Some ""official"" solutions are not optimal even with the learnt skills up to that point.You have to understand that in programming nothing is chiseled in stone. There usually are several paths that lead to the goal. Some are more efficient than others, some are better readable/maintainable than others, and some are good middle-grounds between efficiency and readability/maintainability - that's the ones a programmer should strive for. If your solution is super intelligent and efficient but you are the only one who understands it, it is useless in production, but may be nice for competitions, if your solution is super slow but extremely readable, you're on the other end of the scale and should work on your speed.It's all a matter of experience.

(any piece in a 200x200 space of course) The problem is, statistically, most art produced is random noise. It's all \*seems\* the same - despite both pieces of noise being very different in terms of data - because both noises communicate the same exact thing to the audience. ""This is random noise"".IMO, to make impactful art, you've\- You've got to understand why and which elements evoke what you want in the audience. \- You've got to understand what is important, what isn't, and tightly control what is important. \- And generate interesting ideas within the work of any sort.The first two require lots of practice and is a soft skill - much like cooking w/o a recipe. The last one, I find, is much easier when I pore over an artwork and let the creative process compound on itself. (And study lots of extraneous subjects or other artworks to pull more ideas from!)Much like you've got to learn how to draw your basics before you can start breaking the rules, I think the biggest problem AI presents is it can undercut the learning process, development of personal styles, & creative process. Much like if you only ever followed ""paint by numbers"" kits and never challenged yourself further.\[Though once you've got your art down, and you find it has a useful part in your workflow, I figure it becomes a tool like any other -- IP issues not withstanding. Albeit I'm cantankerous and refuse to give up any control to blackboxes : P. And can't really see how'd I use it in a way that isn't covered by photobashing & art archives ha!

o3bfxq4,"Everything is normal - a lot of people like to confuse things further by talking about passing by reference or value or copying, etc. This usually only confuses things further.Let me try to show an example - first with an integer (code isn't Dart or anything in particular, mostly pseudocode): int v1 = 5; // first we declare a variable 'v1' with a value of '5' myFunc(v1); // then we send that variable as an argument to the function def myFunc( v2 ) { // in the function, the variable 'v2' is now also set to the value '5' print( v2 ) // as we can see if we print it v2 = 4; // but then we change 'v2' to '4' // 'v1' was never changed }Then if we use lists - the result is actually exactly the same: list l1 = ['c','a','t']; // we declare a list 'l1' with 'c','a' and 't' myListFunc( l1 ); // then we send that list as an argument to the function def myListFunc( l2 ) { // in that function, the variable 'l2' is now set to the same list // of 'c','a','t' print( l2 ); // as we can see if we print it l2 = ['d','o','g']; // but when we change 'l2' to another list of 'd','o','g' // the original 'l1' was never changed }Some people like to argue that 'v2' becomes a copy of 'v1' but 'l2' becomes a reference to 'l1' - this isn't entirely correct, and in my opinion only muddies the water. The important thing is that when you set a variable = some other value, it doesn't matter where it originally got its value from, it is gone. And setting v2 = v1 doesn't ""link"" v2 and v1 in any way, it just makes them have the same value.Now for the tricky part!A value like 4 and 5 cannot be changed, setting v1 to 5 and then setting v2 to v1 and v2 to 4, does not change neither 4 nor 5, it only changes the variables v1 and v2.But a *value* like a list, **can be changed**, you can replace individual items, add or remove them - it is still the same list. You cannot replace or remove anything in the number 5.So this code does change the inside of l1: list l1 = ['c','a','t']; // we declare a list 'l1' with 'c','a' and 't' myOtherListFunc( l1 ); // then we send that list as an argument to the new function def myOtherListFun( l2 ) { // and receive the same list as variable 'l2' l2.add('s'); // and we modify the inside of the list! // this has also changed the list for 'l1' because it is the same list }There's nothing magic about it - note that we don't write `l2 = ['c','a','t','s']` because that would change l2 to be another list, just like v2 was changed to be another number.If we could write `v2.increment()` or something like that, we would be able to change v1 through v2, but as that is usually not the case in most languages, programmers like to say that numbers are copied and lists are referenced - although it rarely is like that.",peterlinddk,2026-02-03 10:04:58,1,learnprogramming,t3_1quc0t2,False,

My understanding was that i gets -- everytime the nested loop ends, so that1. i starts right2. j start at index 03. compare the charAt i and j4. true if correct, continues the block5.gets to the end of the 1st loop j++ and gets to the end of the 2nd loop block and i-- 6. restart with i length -1 and j at 1, compares again. 7. does this until i hits 0 (which i should change to >0 and not >=0,) and for j until it hits length-1This doenst seem to be what happens tho, according to your comments.Thank you very much btw! :D",Commercial-Novel-611,2026-01-30 09:43:27,2,learnprogramming,t3_1qr0ke4,True,

You will notice a lot of slop. perhaps N+1 queries , caching not implemented where it's needed. Build a list of quick wins you can get.If the code is very complex which more often it is because of AI , you can rewrite the complex parts and abstract them in declartive functions this is really useful.If the classes are intertwined you need to decide how to seperate the existing componentes , will you use DI or perhaps there is some oppurtinites of inhertince where we can reuse code.

o3sszz2,"That's not bad practice, it's a common and useful pattern.When people say functions are ""first-class objects"" in Python, it just means you can treat functions like any other value. You can assign them to variables, pass them to other functions, or store them in data structures like lists and dictionaries. Not all languages allow this.one clarification is that you're not actually storing the function itself in the dictionary. you're storing a *reference* to it (called a pointer). The function exists once in memory, and the dictionary just holds a way to find it. That's why you write `""start"": start_game` without parentheses, with parentheses you'd be *calling* the function and storing its return value instead.Typical use cases:```python# Command dispatchcommands = { ""start"": start_game, ""quit"": quit_game, ""help"": show_help,}action = commands.get(user_input)if action: action() # Now we call it``````python# Replacing long if/elif chainsdef handle_event(event_type, data): handlers = { ""click"": handle_click, ""submit"": handle_submit, ""load"": handle_load, } handler = handlers.get(event_type, handle_unknown) return handler(data)```This is cleaner than a sprawling if/elif block, easier to extend, and the mapping is explicit. You'll see this pattern in CLI tools, event systems, parsers, and state machines.The only things to watch for is to make sure the functions have compatible signatures if you're calling them uniformly, and don't over-complicate simple cases where a basic `if` would be fine",Eogcloud,2026-02-05 22:30:37,5,learnprogramming,t3_1qwz48z,False,

Add quality of life features6. \^Build internal tools to help with automation and testing such as a data generator.7. Improve dashboard and alerting capabilities. Check if there are any metrics you can track that will help alert you of any issues with your project. If none exists, create a metrics dashboard or try to get your team/company to adopt one from the various providers. You could even keep it simple and create a cron job on a linux server that executes a script daily to pull metrics from your logs and database to alert you of any issues. Though there better solutions.8. Study anything related to your job. Learn what you need to in order to eventually help your teammates with their load. Learn more about intricacies of the languages used in your stack. Research tools and libraries that may help your project.

o2mneie,"Traditional engineer here (chemical, not that it matters)... turns out, USA vs. Europe area engineering or not that makes little difference. It looks like, checks the replies, a lot of software developers are just toxic regardless of where they live. A lot of you all are really arguing about stupid shit. Software development isn't a zero sum game, for US developers to win, EU doesn't have to lose, and vice versa.Do we chalk this up to people just being young? Do European posters in /r/cscareerquestions ALSO skew young and NOT actually employed as software developers, just like the US counterparts?Anyways, unlike many people here, I regularly during the course of my work, engage with large teams of European engineers. Primarily engineers from Ireland, Poland, and Germany. Ireland is unique, in that it also has a large diaspora of engineers from OTHER European countries. These have included multiple engineers from England, Spain, and France, and Architects from Ireland, Italy, and England.Two things that have helped dramatically, are: Persistent and clear communication. Both parties need to be patient, and be ""clear"" with their communication. English will be the lingua fraca, but all English is not the same. Focus on using COMMON, more likely to be known, phrases, words, etc. Avoid idioms that someone not from your country isn't going to know. It's REALLY common for native speakers/writers to go crazy with this and communicate in a way that is very difficult to understand. Simplify it down. Assume positive intent, if something SOUNDS off, it's probably a bad translation. Every language has it's own difficulties in translation to English. Above all else, patience by BOTH parties.The other, is absolutely when working with counterparts in other cultures, you HAVE to learn and understand what their leadership and accountability paradigm is, relative to yours. Do NOT assume it is the same way, at all, to yours. How people are led (do people DEFER to leadership, or INFORM leadership), how people are mentored, how people are held accountable, differs WILDLY between cultures; and, even within that culture, particularly in Poland I see big differences between junior and senior engineers. I suspect in that country there's a divide there too; if I had to guess, it's roughly the 15+ and above vs. the newer peeps. But, I don't fully understand, despite how much polish interaction I get.With that last one, comes ASSUME positive intent. Assume they WANT to get the job done, and done well, and seek to understand how and why they're behaving the way they are. A metaphor I like to use borrows from the old American story about the cherry tree and the axe. If ""Culture A"" was going to cut down a tree, and had 10 hours to do it, how many hours would they spend sharpening the axe?"" The polish would sharpen the axe, and a backup axe, for 9.5 hours. The Irish? They cut it down last week. My point? The spread between preparing for the act, and doing the act, varies wildly, and can be a VERY common source of frustration ALL around.Anyways, good luck.

The PIPs fly faster in other LOBs.- Are you okay with mediocrity? Not sure about your offer, but some teams don’t do flashy work. The tech stacks are bloated and poorly written by contractors. Some may have modern stacks.- How long do you see yourself working there? The WLB is fairly good, but the performance culture grinds years off your life for a mediocre pay and no RDU.&nbsp;I’ll also note, SA while a shit pay, will offer more shelter from PIPs than for PAs. I was a PA and TL and the competition gets tighter the more up the chain you go.",SweatyAd8914,2026-02-04 15:15:10,35,cscareerquestions,t3_1qvqdy6,False,
o3kg5cc,"Former C1 employee here. It’s the sketchiest company I’ve ever worked for. Left after I fulfilled my time requirement to not pay back the signing bonus & Relocation package. C1 tries to operate as if they’re AWS, the problem is that they’re not paying AWS money. They like to intentionally over-hire & rely on pip culture to incentivize employees to overwork themselves to be ranked appropriately. That leads me to my next thing, they do stack ranking for employees. This means that you’ll be ranked against employees at the same level as you & normally that would be fine, but a lot of orgs have company lifers. These people have been there their entire career or the majority of their career & they know the company inside & out so they’ll consistently set an incredibly high bar that new external hires have to adhere to within a few months of working at the company. With a company so reliant on internal systems that are poorly documented & long drawn-out (again, poorly documented) processes it’s hard to learn all of that while also navigating all the levels of bureaucracy & compliance that comes with fintech. Quite frankly unless you grossly overwork yourself on a regular basis for a year or two or you’re just an incredibly talented engineer it’s unlikely you’ll succeed there. Here are some additional things that you may find useful to know:- They reorg frequently, I’m talking every 6 months at least. So you’ll constantly be shifting teams or lose team members- Everything there is reliant on tons of internal tools & many basic things you’ll have to do will take significantly longer than expected because you have to ask many people who to contact about something then you have to fill out a form & then message someone to tell them you filled out the form then fill out the form again because you forgot to check a certain field on the form- The way the company operates with pip culture breeds a lot of toxic behavior between employees so you’ll encounter a lot of terrible behavior throughout your interactions. Plenty of good people there, but the amount of bad interactions you’ll encounter is relatively high.- as a woman you might find it relevant to know that there’s not many women working there in the engineering departments. I was there for a little over a year & I found out about 3 different serious scandals there involving harassment & encountered a lot of higher ups who are not very respectful towards women. All that being said, they do pay pretty decent, but in my opinion they do not pay nearly enough for how much it sucks to work there. If you’re up to date on your interview skills I highly recommend interviewing elsewhere.

I also felt similar about the job market making such a move risky right now.I’m not saying don’t do it. But you still have time to investigate. If you get the offer, don’t say yes right away. A day later, tell your recruiter you have some concerns you want to clarify. They’ll likely ask if you want to meet with the hiring manager or anyone else to discuss them. If it’s a good group of people they’ll be happy to do so. Then you can prepare some questions that might help you understand the situation better. You can even bring up what you’ve seen online.

The real world experience of coding was nothing like school; I enjoyed support a lot more so I moved into getting work doing on site technical support on contracts at oil extraction sites.It was relatively easy to hop from contract to contract, make a lot of connections, and eventually I moved to do on site IT support for a regional authority.Having the various experiences from the contracts and the programing experience really helped out with seeing problems in a different light and finding unique solutions.I rarely program now, mostly it's just problems that come my way that no one else can figure out because they don't know where to begin. Really it all comes down to being able to understand how to parse large datasets into useful information.I can understand it, I can explain it, most of my team can't comprehend it; so I rapid prototype the solution, meet with various teams, and we get a usable product that prevents us from having to do a RFP for 5 to 10 million dollars a year.I assume there are other roles that are related to computer science that exist in which you can still use your education, training, and knowledge; but it might be a pretty niche job market - regional company, not huge, but not tiny. Big enough to pay we'll, small enough that 5 million dollars a year on savings makes a difference, also in house IT.

This is because trash schools do not prepare you to pass the interview. You are better off doing community college for first 2 years to get the required classes out of the way for cheap. Then you take a few basic computer science classes. Then in state tuition nearby for the last 2 years.Real computer science is hard and time consuming. If you can't handle that, you won't pass the interviews. WGU or any of the for profit trash does NOT prepare you to go to work or to PASS THE INTERVIEW.So basically there are 3 tiers of schoolsIvy league or equivalent.

Most of these will prepare you to pass the interviews.For profit trash that is useless diploma mill crap and you will fail the interviews.Bottom line: Do ivy league or do instate tuition. Id also argue that any other private college is a waste of money because its much more debt and won't prepare you for the interview.

o3rchns,"Okay so first I'll answer the general question, but then explain why this is less relevant for your specific case- Ivy League/high-prestige engineering schools- Specialty engineering schools (co-op programs, niche in-demand fields, etc)- the majority of schools (4-year mostly in person schools)- 100% online, shorter time period tracks, community college (for some employers)- non-accredited, non-standard degrees (e.g. I knew a private school that only did liberal arts degrees with ""focuses"") The perception of online schools is that they dont train you well for a work environment and they're easier to pass. This is about the same view as bootcamp-only people--its better than nothing, but it's just taken as nowhere near the same as the above.THAT SAID, for your specific case of already having a different degree **and teaching the subject**, I think WGU is a pretty good option. You already clearly have the interpersonal and project management skills needed to be functional in a workplace, and youre even more aligned since you have actually been doing some amount of programming already.I think you'll still struggle to get those first few jobs just because the career track is so railroaded towards the typical ""new grad with internships climbing up the ladder,"" but you absolutely can do it. I STRONGLY recommend freelancing to get your foot in the door, since it'll mean not needing to drop off of your teaching job. Tbh, if you can convince someone to let you build them a plugin for their website or make some open-source contributions, I think you could even end up with a ""typical eng job"" without a degree (though I don't recommend this).Anyways, my advice to you is1. Get the WGU degree2. While getting the degree, really really seek out a project or two from peers nearby. Maybe the school website could use some updating. Maybe your buddy wants clients to be able to schedule an appointment online rather than call him. These jobs will replace the typical ""internship"" experience companies want.3. Afterwards, seek out workplaces that can leverage your background. There is a TON of education tech being made by folk who have no idea what educators need.4. Be resilient. You're entering into a tumultuous field later than your competitors. There are going to be instances and people that make you feel small.

Mind you, you also don't fit the typical case of an intern, as you are actually a new grad. I think the biggest thing to get used to is the idea that it's okay for work to not be finished. You're not actually being paid by task.

Catch up ASAP.>How do I earn the respect of my coworkers?What I just said above + do your stuff well + make sure you are a team multiplier in some ways or another.>I also feel like an idiot sometimes in general because the product itself and the code is very complex. The product is for a niche field I’m not very familiar with.I know redditors hate to hear this but spend more hours (this means outside work hours) figuring out wtf is going on. And if there's little to no documentation on what you think is important knowledge, document it and share it to the team (this shows you are 'team multiplier' and will look good to your performance review). And if there's any documents regarding the product, just read through it even if you don't understand it multiple times here and there again and again (so your eyes at least get used to the technical jargon, etc).Type or screenshot everything in your note taking app or whatever per day. Every command you ran and so forth so you can look back. I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I recommend it if you don't use a note taking app (it's very bare bones and light). And I have Calender plugin on it.If your company allows you to use AI on the codebase, abuse the heck out of AI and ask all sorts of questions on it.Schedule 1 on 1 meetings with your teammates and ask questions on topics you don't know much about. Don't schedule and just be like ""I don't know"". People don't like that. People like you put in SOME effort to try so show you put in the effort to try to make sense and are confused/lost. And screenshot every single step your teammate is doing so you don't forget or lose (so you can help organize later). Also, DM your teammates with help you need (do it to different team members a time so you don't overload one teammate). And make sure that DM (Slack setting or whatever is set to never delete). And again, screenshot/save any command, etc that comes out of it.Type more shit about your status and what you are doing in your team channel more. Last thing you want is to look invisible. Invisible == Looks like you aren't doing anything.I abuse the heck out of screenshotting in this field. Everything in every meeting when I see a screen is screenshot. I don't care how trivial. From the URL to what not I just screenshot.If this is in office, bribe your team members (and other close by office workers (from where you sit)) with occasional cookies/snacks or whatever. Look optimistic and happy and eager. It goes a long way and will help you with your performance reviews indirectly (welcome to life).Ah and the biggest thing. **When you are given a task, stop trying to focus on the task. Try to understand the bigger picture first (the REASON behind the task and so forth). Make sure you focus on that in 1on1 when asking your team members for help on a task.**If you focus on 'code logic' context, then you are f-ed. You need to focus on the business/overall reason for why this task was given.

I can get the creative juices flowing and type away the letter in about ten minutes or so. So, there is certainly a usefulness to Ai.I also certainly do not want to tell you which way is better over the other.

Turns out I have a.d.h.d. and autism and if I had been able to be medicated through school, I would have been unstoppable.I was pretty bitter trying to find work in 2008-2011 in video games while learning and programming in C++ for ""the game"" I had in my head. Then once I would know what ""the game"" was, I would do some research and find out that someone else had the idea and had already done it.That's when it hit me, the ideas are a dime a dozen, and everyone has them; it's being able to make it into a reality and get it to market faster than the competition that gets the money.The secret, kookily enough, was watching the movie ""the secret"" and saying to myself ""If I am always saying that I am burned out and there are no jobs, then that is my reality"". So instead I said ""I am a positive person, pleasant to be around, I love people, and there are lots of jobs I would enjoy (each of those was a lie)"".I just had that mindset and I just flipped the job search rules on its head and I just applied for everything that looked interesting. I had one resume, one cover letter, a few letters of reference, and then I just ""cold job applied"", or ""shotgun approach"". I just stopped looking at the job, the description, the requirements, and instead of stressing about if I qualified for a job or tailoring my resume and cover letter for one hour and then applying for one job in two hours, I did a blanket google search, opened up the top ten results in tabs, and just went through uploading my resume and cover letter to sites and applying for as many jobs as I could. Some were an email, some were uploading documents, some were transcribing into their web fields, so some took a minute to apply to, some took 20 minutes. I just applied and applied and applied.I ""knew"" everyone else was going to be tailoring their resume to the job, so instead of me doing that for each one, I wrote the cover letter like it was a personal conversation between friends and I sold myself as an amazing worker and someone they wanted on their team.I'd been applying for about a day before I got a call for a job where they were looking for a permanent full time position (but I didn't know that cause I hadn't really read the job listing). I had a 2 year technical diploma and had just finished my 3rd year of a bsc in computer science, I was on summer break...So I went to the preliminary interview and fucking nailed it with my positive attitude and my honest answers of ""I don't know what that is or how to do it, but I honestly don't know what I am doing with most things. What I know how to do is know when I don't know, I know how to look something up, and I learn fast"".They ended up hiring me for a summer rather than any of the other full time applicants that they had. I fucking love automation and I get bored easily. It was a tech support job for a software development company, so everytime I answered a question, I templated the response. There's really only 20 questions anyone could have about this software, and I knew what they were cause I had been doing templated responses from May to July.In July I asked to get some screen recording and captioning software to make some tutorial videos; I made basic, intermediate, and advanced video tutorials, published them, and the calls stopped.I had automated myself out of a job, and then I went back to school and finished my fourth year.I had a competitive job offer from them half way through the year, full benefits, to come back and work for them. It was a great company, it got acquired during covid, but I did basically the same thing for them for 3 years before moving on.I just kept looking at something that had to be done more than once and figured out how to automate it.The moral of this story is sometimes you have to run before you can walk. Successfully selling yourself and taking initiative to do your job and improve everything, rather than just collecting a cheque allowed me to develop a specific set of skills.I work for a much bigger company now, ""work"" is a strong term. I do tech support and am on a team with other people where we get sent problems no one can figure out how to fix. We figure it out, fix it, and automate it.I never would have figured that out without actually doing it.",I_IdentifyAsAstartes,2026-01-30 22:06:02,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1qrg9a0,False,
o2oj6r7,"I have, but not anything I think is impressive. I’ve made a very short choose your own adventure style text based web game, I’ve worked on some games in game maker back when I was in high school but I don’t currently have access to what I made since it was for a class on the school’s computers, made some simple Scratch games as well as designing a board game in that same class back in the day. For related art stuff I’ve made some animations recently (2D hand drawn digital animations) such as a basic looping character walk cycle from one angle and a few other simple animations, and I’ve also drawn some 2D digital art for a very brief unfinished game demo group project in university too but I didn’t end up doing any of the code for that one. I’ve also made the very basic typical low quality snake game almost everyone does at some point. Also I found out I kinda suck at 3D animation and rigging in Blender.I think I’m probably more interested in the creative aspects (game design/mechanics, visuals, story/writing, characters) than actual coding but maybe I haven’t worked deep enough into the actual coding parts to really know for sure. I think maybe everything I’ve done so far is too surface level to really have a clear picture currently.

ADHD does run in my family and I have a brother who was formally diagnosed, and every time I look into the symptoms of both ADHD and autism I relate to a lot of it. My only worry is the possibility that having formal diagnoses could lead to issues if I want to move out of the U.S. or cause discrimination based on having that on my medical record (more worried about autism as opposed to ADHD for that knowing how autistic people often get mistreated, seen as incompetent, and infantilized).",OssifiedAngel,2026-01-30 22:24:41,1,cscareerquestions,t1_o2oodld,True,

""Thank you for your time and interest in *Tungsten Automation*""Block and report and move on with your life.Edit: Oh, another red flag is ""Mr Christian Deppisch."" Nobody in the US would actually put ""Mr"" on their name, but it's apparently common convention in the former-colonial countries where many scammers operate. It's used very commonly in scam communications.Edit 2: apparently, when deciding whether number is a spammer, your cell phone service weighs the number of spam reports against the number of people who reply. By getting many people to reply with ""got it"", even if most of those people don't become scam victims, the scammers are helping to not get their numbers banned by inflating the number of replies.",tippiedog,2026-02-02 20:59:34,4,cscareerquestions,t3_1qu50jt,False,

The idea is take the nebulous scary thing and break it into smaller pieces, rinse and repeat until things start to look more concrete. E.g. for a webdev project, maybe there's frontend and backend, and then maybe in the frontend there's pages, and each page has components, and so on, down the rabbit hole you go, until you've got a list of concrete tasks that can be unambiguously be marked as done or not done.If you can't tame your panic attacks, then the pragmatic option is stick with your non tech job.
