Often I would concede to a different design, and after some time the team would arrive at what dimensional modelling advises. E.g they wanted to mix detailed data with aggregated snapshots in one table. I did not wantnto argue. I said ""well Kimball advises against this because its trouble"" and let them build it. After some time they split the fact tables into transaction and aggregate.It is not Kimball's ideas in the book, but experience of a wide industry practicioners over years of working with data.

I still look have to look up the things I do less often like window functions and pivots. Then I added Python and Pandas and started building new things and constantly looked for ways to make it better. Talked to people, read things, tried PyArrow, Polars, DuckDB, dot, on and on. There’s way too much out there to be an expert in all of it and AI can help with what to try next.What really makes a senior is experience and understanding what’s best to use in what use cases, how to automate, how to keep it performant, how to make sure the data is right, and where the many, many gotchas are. Learn the Python fundamentals, and then build. Don’t beat yourself up about googling syntax, it’ll stick eventually. There’s no substitute for building, and the only way to learn new ways is to read code.

Business folks need someone to make sense of the data chaos, and it’s pretty satisfying to be the one who stitches it together into something useful.I’ve been director-level for about 15 years and managed to stay pretty hands-on until recently. Even now, I try to keep up so I can actually lead effectively, and I’ll jump at any excuse to write some code just to stay sharp (and maybe flex a bit for the team!).If you’re losing passion, I’d seriously look at changing projects or orgs before bailing on the field.

A lot of the teams organically adopted systems and contractors and do own their own data. But they aren't generally technical users and there was no governance or standards. And all the data became siloed. The central DE team is working to unsilo the data. Our goal is to eventually create data standards and enforce them so the data is actually a good quality. This is a slow process, but I'm optimistic. The central BI team does seem to have a problem with scale. At my company, most of the functional users don't have BI experts and can't use PBI - at least nowhere near the quality that the BI team does. However, the BI team moves quite slowly to produce the reporting. The result is that functional teams build their own custom, low governance, reporting off the centralized data out of necessity. By the time BI develops the right tools, the business doesn't need it anymore and doesn't want to switch. My untested idea is to give the business access to easy to use cloud based dashboarding tools (like Sigma for example). Then BI provides support, underlying data models, and connectivity to non enterprise grade sources like SharePoint. In short, decentralizing everything without governance cannot work. Centralizing everything without a plan to scale cannot work. A data mesh is the tightrope that attempts to balance this.

In reality, the vast majority of companies do not. The key is to not throw out the baby with the bath water. For every “failed” implementation of Mesh, Agile, Hadoop, etc we’ve had through the years there has been incremental progress, evidenced by the plethora of options we have today to build data engineering stacks and teams to fit the different needs of companies. For me, data mesh was indicative of a paradigm shift from the old school prescriptive warehouse to a modern democratization enabled and fueled by the cycle of real-world problem solving.

We didn’t say we were implementing Data Mesh because few outside IT knew about it or understood it. Instead, our aim was to modernize the data platform, speed up delivery of technical solutions, and empower the business with self-service capabilities and less reliance on the IT organization.We were successful in many areas while other elements remained a challenge. For example, we migrated the two largest data platforms from on-premises, self-hosted and managed servers, to native services in the public cloud. Later, we built “lakehouse” capabilities on top of the public cloud platform. These included data governance features, automated data security, and data domains built for key areas of the business such as human resources, marketing, supply chain, etc. The benefits were quite profound. Within the first 2 years we had empowered 50+ business teams. Between year 1 and year 2 we saw 500% growth in teams able to use their data and the platform to create things that matter. Business teams recognized improved decision-making across the enterprise, increased efficiency and cost savings, accelerated speed-to-value for data product creation, and secure data sharing between teams.While we experienced success, the challenges were many. Some teams thought the changes were just another fad IT came up with. Given their prior experiences they were honestly justified in thinking that. Other teams were interested but couldn’t get their leadership to buy in or they didn’t have enough technical chops to harness their domain data on their own. They continued to rely on central IT. Other business teams were so focused on their own projects and demands they simply couldn’t make the initial shift. They asked us to come back later. A thru line that helped in most situations was having clear executive leadership support (CIO, CEO, CDO, and others). They would knock down roadblocks where needed and help provide resources when we got stuck.After 3 years in the journey one thing was abundantly clear. Technology was not the largest challenge. People and culture were. It took tremendous energy to cast the vision and bring people and teams along with us. This required persistent communication with all business teams and clear demonstration of the value of public cloud through demos, pilots, and “soft releases” of products, apps, and services. The technical teams (platforms, cloud, data, security) all became storytellers if they weren’t already.

You need very clean, very well tagged, very well modelled data. The example I always give is that if you go to the table marked “sales” and count the number of sales…. That is not even remotely correct. Years of schema evolution, changes to products, and poor engineering mean the actual number is much harder to derive. For conversational analytics, the prompts must be very carefully tuned and the AI will straight up invent things if you aren’t careful. I would not trust it in the least.For the CoSQL model, I haven’t tried to use it, but I notice that solution architects are suggesting I use it rather than curating dbt so I can use that to control our transformation logic. In that regard, it’s a complete distraction and a massive net-negative.“We don’t have working data products” is the same problem we have had for years and it’s the same problem that will make AI tools harder to implement even if they are viable, but it’s far too unsexy an issue to attract attention.I am hoping that if I can make clear the dependency that AI has on working data products it might get me the resources and tooling I have needed all along.",GrandOldFarty,2025-12-14 13:11:46,43,dataengineering,t3_1pmda5y,False,

However, large language models are not very good at doing abstract reasoning on anything other than text, which includes a lot of the work you do as an analyst by traslating some fuzzy business logics to maths, at least for anything nontrivial beyond textbook problems. You may attempt to alleviate this somewhat by providing good metadata for context, but my experience is that this doesn't really solve the problem and i very much doubt this will improve untill we get a different class of models all together as the ""more data+larger models"" approach yields diminishing returns due to sublinear scaling of LLMs wrt. data and size.Note: you should take everything i say with a grain of salt, as i am a practitioner using LLMs and my formal training is in physics, not NLP.",TaylorExpandMyAss,2025-12-14 13:14:53,12,dataengineering,t3_1pmda5y,False,

As this will change the comments, based on your constraints.DuckDB for olap processing, easy install on a Linux-VM, only heard great things about it. Microsoft has the free SQL Server Express for OLTP - perfect for staging area - 10 gig limit per database - so have a DB per source and ingest, you'll have 2 cpu peformance and decent ram usage (16g I think, check Microsoft's web page).So what's nice with SQL Server Express is it plays nice with your AD and talks easily to other MSSQL systems, so you can avoid flat files when flat files don't make sense.If you want history of all changes, without the hassle of CDC, flat files on a massive file share dedicated for this, you basically emulate a datalake. If this file share system is Linux, there's probably Datalake compatible open-source you can use so you can do SELECT directly on the CSV/Json/XML flat files, just like a real cloud datalake. But I haven't done it - I'm sure someone here has.In any case, Google Big Query and even Azure Datalake are not expensive. Probably on-par with dedicated hardware costs internally adding a 4TB mirrored fileshare system, when costed and budgeted over 36 months.It depends on CAPEX versus OPEX, your boss should know this.

nu46kmh,"I mean there isn’t really all that much to learn, it’s just one type of model definition on dbt. I think this medium article describes it pretty well: [https://mbvyn.medium.com/understanding-dbt-incremental-materialization-c32318364241](https://mbvyn.medium.com/understanding-dbt-incremental-materialization-c32318364241)Incr models load existing tables with more data using various loading strategies. The article explains these well. Key concept here is loading only what you need to, making it useful in situations where the amount of data is very large and/or compute is a concern.A key thing to understand would be is\_icremental(), which is a function which will return True if the model it is being applied in *already exists* in the warehouse (and is also an incremental model which is not running in full-refresh)That means anything wrapped within is\_incremental() won’t be applied the first time you run a model, or when you fully refresh it.This is what you use to compare existing records in your target with your source so you only load the new and/or updated records, depending on your strategy.You can also flip that and use NOT is\_incremental(), meaning that what you wrap it around will only run the first time the model is built (or on full refreshes). That could for example be if you have some old stale data that you need to union with on the first run, but then never need to look at again, except for the case of a full refresh.EDIT: For some clarity, heres an example of an incremental model from dbt docs.If this model has never been run before, or needs to be fully refreshed (reloaded) then `{% if is_incremental() %}` will evaluate to false, meaning that the SQL it wraps wont be sent to the warehouse. That makes sense, since `{{ this }}` will be rendered as the incremental models name. Hard to do a select from something that doesnt exist yet right? We need to compare event\_time in source with what we have loaded before, which we cant do if we've never loaded it.Once we've loaded data for the first time, the if statement will evaluate to true, meaning the WHERE clause gets put into effect. Then the models SQL will return results using that filtering, and that's what ends up getting inserted into the target table in your DWH. {{ config( materialized='incremental' ) }} select *, my_slow_function(my_column) from {{ ref('app_data_events') }} {% if is_incremental() %} -- this filter will only be applied on an incremental run -- (uses >= to include records whose timestamp occurred since the last run of this model) -- (If event_time is NULL or the table is truncated, the condition will always be true and load all records) where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from {{ this }} ) {% endif %}",vickelajnen,2025-12-15 06:32:11,5,dataengineering,t3_1pmwjju,False,

nu67tkw,"There’s actually a few things to be concerned with. One issue is making sure you are dealing with the proper timestamp. A lot of the examples in this space gloss over this aspect. For high water mark incremental processing you want to drive off of the timestamp representing the moment the record was written in your data warehouse/lakehouse/dbt. You do not want to rely on the application timestamp or the timestamp generated by your source system for incremental processing. For the purposes of this conversation, let’s assume `table_a` and `table_b` both represent this in a column named `dbt_updated_ts`.Another concern is persisting these timestamps in your target model. You will need to decide on `table_a.dbt_updated_ts` as `table_a_dbt_updated_ts` and `table_b.dbt_updated_ts` as `table_b_dbt_updated_ts` or doing something like `least(table_a.dbt_updated_ts, table_b.dbt_updated_ts) as source_dbt_updated_ts`. Regardless of the decision, you should *also* re-state a `dbt_updated_ts` for downstream consumers of your model. They should *not* look at your various source timestamps for incremental processing, only your new `dbt_updated_ts`And this is where the rub comes in. Now you have 2 sources with 2 different timestamps and you need to process them incrementally. A comprehensive way of doing this would be to take all the keys above the high water mark in source a and union with the keys above the high water mark in source b, union the keys together, then use that to scan both tables again to make sure you catch all the changes. Generally this is computationally expensive, although it should give the correct answer.If you are doing this to create something like a SCD type-2 dimension it gets more complicated on top of this, as you will now need to deal with the temporal aspects of your source system as well.I would warn you of this: if someone says add a lookback window, that is usually to cover some architectural sin. This should be questioned.It’s complicated and often computationally expensive to process multiple upstreams in an incremental fashion. Do not forget the maintenance cost: next month you will have an engineer who thinks they are clever and will mess with this logic and it may be ok for most cases but not certain edge cases. KISS. If you can, just materialize any model with multiple upstreams as `table` and save yourself the headache.

nu5lr9u,"You'll want to establish a single \`event\_time\` field (like the person mentioned that responded to you above) that you can use to check if a row needs to be updated by your incremental model.So if you're unioning multiple tables: SELECT id, action_date AS event_time FROM table_a UNION ALL SELECT id, event_at AS event_time FROM table_b UNION ALL SELECT id, timestamp AS event_time FROM table_cand then use `event_time` as your condition in your WHERE clause",creamycolslaw,2025-12-15 13:52:49,3,dataengineering,t1_nu5e134,False,
nu5hnle,"Depends on what you mean.If you're joining/unioning/selecting from other up stream incremental models, you don't really need to think about how they are materialized. At least I can't think of a scenario where you would need to consider that. I could also be completely wrong here, not something I've really given any thought.If you mean in the context of joins/unions within the same model, you still only really have to think about where and when you apply the is\_incremental() macro. To use the above example again (but expanded a bit), say we have some old stale data that we need to load, e.g. from some old source system, and then we're adding data from the new system on top. We still keep the same fields and everything.In this example, the first time we run the model, the first incremental macro will return false, because the model deosnt exist in our target dwh yet. The second macro will return true, since the target table doesnt exist yet. So then we will run the main query, and then union in the old data.On every subsequent run, the first macro will return true, and the second one false. So on all future runs, we will be filtering data from the new system, and disregarding the old one entirely, since no new data is being generated there.So we wrap SQL we want to compile and send to the warehouse depending on the context in which the model is running. In practice I've only used this to wrap a WHERE (most common), CTE's or UNIONs. You can also include multiple wrapped statements as below, for example we might apply an incremental macro inside our CTE's in order to make the model more performant. I find it hard to imagine a scenario where you would wrap it around a join. {{     config(         materialized='incremental'     ) }} select     customer_id,     period,     total_sales from {{ ref('app_data_events_from_new_system') }} {% if is_incremental() %}     where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from {{ this }} ) {% endif %} {% if not is_incremental() %}     union     select         customer_id,         period,         total_sales     from  {{ ref('app_data_events_from_old_system') }} {% endif %}This means that the compiled SQL will look like one of these 2 (excluding all of the DML that dbt builds in order to actually insert the data into the target table): -- FIRST RUN RESULTS IN select     customer_id,     period,     total_sales from new_db.new_schema.app_data_events_from_new_system     union     select         customer_id,         period,         total_sales     from  old_db.old_schema.app_data_events_from_old_system -- SUBSEQUENT RUNS RESULT IN select     customer_id,     period,     total_sales from new_db.new_schema.app_data_events_from_new_system where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from target_db.target_schema.target_table_with_app_data_from_both_source_systems)",vickelajnen,2025-12-15 13:28:30,1,dataengineering,t1_nu5e134,False,
nug07et,"Last paragraph imo is the big one. I have hardly met any coworkers that understand the problems that come with incrementals involving multiple tables. This means all of the incrementals they've built involving multiple tables are impossible to reproduce from scratch because those incremental tables are not being updated correctly. Had an entire database in a previous company where they would have to regularly refresh all of the datasets because of this and it would sometimes crash in the process. Absolute mess.For me, because I have the skillsets to do so, I pretty much prefer to stay away from any sort of incremental involving multiple tables and use table materializations like you mention unless I 1) really need it and 2) can implement it in a more generic way rather than a custom incremental model. More generic being something like a custom materialization or macro. For example, we have an incremental materialization that checks counts of the source query vs the incremental table by the incremental timestamp to load deltas. This makes the actual SQL in the DBT model involve no incremental logic and makes the DBT model robust to source data that sometimes updates some historical data instead of only inserting new data. If this scenario had been implemented as a basic DBT append-only incremental model (which it was before it got refactored), then the data would not match reporting from the source system.The example I gave speaks to another problem that goes beyond what you bring up (engineer that thinks they're being smart). There's also the problem that often times engineers will develop something with some assumption for how it's going to work in their mind. ""Oh, well we should only get new data for this process every day."" This is only sometimes true. I've worked at multiple companies and every company has had at least a couple of processes you might expect to work that way but don't for business or engineering reasons. For example, if you have a DBT model that involves updates from multiple tables, what happens if table A is updated later than table B? Then on the next run, you may have to update your incremental on late-arriving data from table A + historical data from table B, which leads to historical updates in your table. Of course, there's other ways to implement these things, but by no means trivial in my experience.",simplybeautifulart,2025-12-17 02:28:31,2,dataengineering,t1_nu67tkw,False,

Note that through the majority of the history of data warehouses the principal platforms were general purpose databases like db2, oracle and sql server.

This can provide a significant edge to performance. * Configuring your database to support query parallelism is also critical at volume. * Database constraints are just as important in OLAP as they are in OLTP - and postgres can provide a ton of value here! You may need to turn them off on massive fact tables, but you can also use them at least with summary & dimension tables. * AWS RDS has pretty slow IO, but other hosting options can provide blisteringly-fast servers. But you may need to have postgres dba skills. * All the above assumes vanilla postgres. Adding extensions for duckdb, columnar storage (hydra), etc can provide faster performance in many cases.FYI: I migrated part of my snowflake reporting to postgres on RDS a few years ago in order to save a bunch of money.

It’s not meant to solve every problem, but if a company constantly brings in new data sources or its existing schemas change several times a year, and it still needs clean, consistent data to work with, Data Vault fits that situation very well.Recently I was Data Architecting in a project, where Data Vault was the solution to the client’s issues. A mid-sized company running an HR platform had thousands of clients but a small internal team, so they relied on many external tools: onboarding, contracts, bookkeeping, payments, their main app, and several new systems planned for the next year. Each tool had its own user table (some even had several users tables), and none of them matched. If you ran count(*) on each system’s user table, you got different numbers every time. Each system stored different pieces of information. Analysts didn’t know which database had the data they needed. Even when they found the right one, joining across systems caused rows to disappear, so they couldn’t trust anything.Data Vault solved this cleanly. We created a single Hub_User table that lists every user across all systems. For each subsystem, we added a satellite tables that hold the columns coming from each system. Everything is connected using the same hash key, so joins always work the same way. Analysts now start from Hub_User, and they know exactly where each system’s data lives. Nothing gets lost during joins. When the company adds another tool next year, the team will only need to add one more satellite, and none of the existing reports will break.This kind of constant change is normal in real data environments, and DV is a design pattern for that.

nuba45t,"This ended up being longer than I expected. Hopefully you find this useful. There's actually a lot to your question.When it comes to designing a mart, I keep the ""analyst"" persona in mind as much as possible. This is my north star, even if I don't have analysts. Querying a star should be simple, not something full of odd case logic, analytic queries, coalesces, and the deep SQL knowledge. Save that for your transformations leading up to the star if needed.Regarding keys specifically, there are several goals I have when designing a mart. From the perspective of the ""analyst"" persona querynig the star:1. Joins (dims to facts) should be done with `INNER JOIN` not `OUTER JOIN` - this is for performance and for usability2. No records should be dropped via join - this is a quality issue, you should not be dropping revenue on the floor because your users dimension is incomplete or late for example3. Join conditions should be singular (e.g. no `AND` in join clause) in nature - this is again for performance and usabilityThe ideal query would look something like this: SELECT SUM(f.revenue) AS revenue, d.customer_name FROM fct_sales AS f INNER JOIN dim_customer AS d ON f.customer_sk = d.customer_sk GROUP BY d.customer_nameThese goals need to be addressed in concert. To do so, you really need a lookup process instead of a hashing strategy.In order to address 1 and 2, you really need to have placeholder records in your dimension for ""unknown"", ""missing"" or ""not applicable"" customers, and your fact table creation needs to use these values as appropriate. You cannot hash your way out of this problem; you need to process your dimension (or at least your dimension lookup) first, and then process your facts. Generally this is done with a lookup table. For item 3 in isolation of 1 and 2, if your dimension is SCD type-1 from a single system then using the source system natural key seems reasonable. Once you have multiple source systems (say, customers from 2 systems) then the natural progression is to either add a `source_system` column and make sure everyone remembers to join on that as well (hint: they won't) or to concatenate your source system with the natural key. This concatenation leaves you with a string key instead of an integer key which now negatively impacts query performance.If your dimension is SCD type-2, it's worse. You are left with something looking like this, which is not obvious to analysts, performs poorly, and is error prone: SELECT SUM(f.revenue) AS revenue, d.customer_name FROM fct_sales AS f INNER JOIN dim_customer AS d ON f.customer_nk = d.customer_nk AND f.transaction_ts BETWEEN d.begin_effective_ts AND d.end_effective_ts GROUP BY d.customer_name Usability note: Is it `BETWEEN` or did you do the right thing and make your `end_effective_ts` the same moment as the next `begin_effective_ts`? I can almost guarantee your analysts will either use `BETWEEN` or worse they won't consider the effective dates at all and `DISTINCT` the result set to get what they want. Honestly, it's doubtful that future engineers will remember which way you went with effective dates either. All the more reason to address this in your transformation while building the mart instead of leaving it to the mart consumers to remember.To achieve goal 3 with SCD type-2, you want to put a SK on the fact that represents the state of the dimension at a point in time (probably the moment of transaction). To do this you will also need a lookup, as you cannot hash your way out of this either.At this point it should be clear that lookups are the way to go. So the real question is why would you want a hash instead of an integer? To me, the answer is now obvious: integers take next to zero compute to calculate, will join more efficiently, have half a chance at clustering in a meaningful way, and are immune to collision.TL;DR integer lookups",raginjason,2025-12-16 10:42:58,2,dataengineering,t3_1pnjmno,False,

nuc1iry,"the SDKs/Tools do not yet have a forward/backwards compatibility check to make sure that changes to the schema yield output that is also compatible with prior schemas, but it's something I plan to add. You can do this today by validating instances against v1 and v2 schemas at the same time. If ypou work with Python, there are two simple command line tools for validation that are part of the ""json-structure"" package: # Validate a schema file json-structure-check schema.json # Validate an instance against a schema json-structure-validate instance.json schema.jsonFrom a lifecycle perspective, you use schemas either where you produce data to ensure that it conforms to a set of rules AND/OR at the consumer end to ensure that it conforms to a set of rules. In code and databases, that structure manifests in column declarations or typed fields, and having a neutral data definition language that comes with ""polyglot"" tooling and know many languages and database table schema dialects is therefore helpful for data structures and data to not get lost in translation.I have very successfully used the specs as instruction files with LLMs (e.g. Copilot) so when you want to infer a schema from existing data structures with the spec in the context, you often get very good results, and from there you are on a type safe path.

nuicjws,"I’ve been struggling with getting ai agents working with my db. IMO it’s an extremely hard problem to solve if you want to get beyond basic questions like how much did client x spend in q4 or whatever.I think the approach you are describing is probably as isolated and secure as you could possibly need to get, and may not be flexible enough to provide real business value. But it depends on what sort of questions you want the agent to answer. If you want agents to do things actual human analysts are currently doing, I think allowing the ai to explore the schema and basically do multi turn “deep research” with access to a large portion of the warehouse plus a semantic layer explaining tables and data relationships is probably going to be needed. My current opinion is that if I was going to something as isolated and controlled as what you are describing I might as well just build a dashboard with those curated views available.",Advanced-Average-514,2025-12-17 13:37:24,2,dataengineering,t3_1pos8n2,False,

nuiqn48,"u/Advanced-Average-514 \- Totally fair take and I agree with the core tradeoff you’re pointing at.A couple clarifications on our intent though:1. We’re not trying to recreate a human analyst doing open-ended exploration (yet). We’re aiming for safe, repeatable workflows first.. the stuff that’s painful today because it’s frequent + operational (support, RevOps, CSM, finance ops), not really deep research or exploration. 2. Dashboards are great when questions are known and stable. Agents get interesting when the question is variable but still bounded, e.g. “why did churn risk spike for these 20 accounts?”, “summarize anomalies by segment”, “draft an escalation note with the relevant context,” etc. The way we're thinking is that these sandboxed, curated views/tools are guardrails - the agent still does the synthesis + narrative + next-step suggestions.3. We’re also treating schema exploration as a separate (higher risk) capability. I agree that to do real analyst work, you probably need: semantic layer + table relationships + multi-turn exploration. But letting an LLM roam your warehouse is also where we foresee getting: cost blowups, accidental joins into sensitive tables, hallucination and more. One more reason we’re starting constrained: **repeatability.** For some of the agent tasks we're aiming for, it’s almost mandatory for teams to yield the same answer for the same/similar questions (or at least the same underlying definition/query) every time. So our plan for now is: **start constrained → earn trust → expand surface area (curated views + sandboxing allows us to do that)** ideally with a semantic layer + policy checks as the expansion path.

What I've experimented more with is snowflake's 'cortex' ecosystem which allows you to do RBAC on curated views with semantic layers. It's still in the data warehouse environment but the agents can only access those curated views.

nuipac3,"All excellent questions.1. Cost and speed - I’m in the process of running benchmarks against progressively larger databases. So far, I’m seeing a maximum 10% overhead in storage for the VCS on the database. Cost is dependent on your architecture, but if we’re going with Aurora RDS, it’s dependent on IOPS. This solution uses Copy-on-Write, so there is an increase in IOPS over just running against production, but less than simply copying all the data. Since it’s also delta-based, the IOPS are only upserts, but those are ran twice (once on the branch, once on the merge into main).2. Difference with Git - generally, you don’t store data in Git outside of small test sets. This is a branch that essentially allows you to run your code in production without ever actually touching production. You connect to the same database, so you don’t need to modify your connection (beyond minor branch variables with can be set via environment). Subsetting your data can result in edge case failures since a subset by definition doesn’t include every case. 3. Blame - you can track blame for every record, every column and row, every constraint just by querying rather than digging into the CDC or building a proper SCD pipeline. 4. Silver bullet solution - that right there is the reason behind this post. I want genuine feedback from the community. I have worked at several jobs where this would be incredibly useful, but that’s only my limited experience. I know there are other, more targeted solutions for the various problems. I wanted to get a sense of others’ experiences to see if this addresses a genuine broad need, or if it’s overkill for the majority of problems. One issue I’ve faced constantly is the introduction of bad data into the production database via improperly structured code which might look fine in git but fails in weird ways when applied to the entire database. This allows you to not just review a PR of the code, but also a PR of the data changes at the same time.",cmcclu5,2025-12-17 14:49:23,1,dataengineering,t1_nuhbbj5,True,
nukczua,"Interesting, I do a lot of work with dev teams around logging, what I’ve found works for us is being clear on the exact code change, logic and format of it. We even help write test cases for them in some cases. We also have dev data flow into our data lake so we can validate and iterate dev data before production so it doesn’t break or mess anything up.This has taken a while to get into strong place for a lot of teams such as buy in from stakeholders, value output and context around what the code does so we can advise on the change, especially around the logger and implementation.For the case of having it tied to git sounds interesting, but we are large org, hundreds of repos and already well defined process for releasing code changes (not necessarily tied to data) so to add have the data change linked to PR would be difficult I think for us to introduce as the there’s a lot of teams, infrastructure and processing for us to validate. Ways we have gone to improve the feedback loop is to get the data show back to people as possible. So getting dev data back, tools to view logs as interactions happen and pushing to be advisors/partners on the logging side. Also running QA checks and validation on dev data to catch drift early has been a massive help to catch things. This is generally through strict types like struct types in spark or pydantic etcThis generally means data engineers try to partner with teams for a log change and setting guidelines and docs on best practices to follow for teams to be self serve. Once a change is implemented, DEs integrate and transform data for other downstream teams and analysts to consume.Definitely not a perfect solution, but has worked well for us. Starting over tomorrow, would I consider a data vcs? Maybe as a trial to experiment but probably not. Data is generally later phase concern when building a product/service unless the data is your product, but usually not the case.Having had to built a service for users and already a key stakeholder of the logging implementation, time spent on data logging was tough to prioritize as needed something built and out the door and made more sense to do after release as a follow up.Having typed structure really has been the biggest help.

Async does not run anything in parallel, and you will not see any performance improvements from in; in fact, overuse of async methods in tight loops can significantly harm performance due to the added overhead of the event queue.Part of why async design is popular in Python and JavaScript is because threads really suck in those languages.

nuay6y4,"So, let me tell ye about the old timey times.What we used to do is load pages in serial. Request came in, and as we processed the page, we'd make database requests, wait for the response, build more page, do more requests, etc. Not great. If you had a long loading page, it might takes 20 seconds or more to load.So we got async. Async was cool because now when a request comes in, I serve you a template and give you some URLs in my API to query. Each makes its own specific action and on completion does something else. Page loads in 0.5s, most of your data is there in <1s, and that one long 15-second query stalling out the old page eventually loads in when ready. Great!However, we ended up with edge cases. Your page loads a complex tab that needs data from 5 dynamic drop-downs that it also has to load data for. That's 5 requests that all get triggering in serial using async or .thens (aka callback hell), or you could hope for the best and occasionally end up with a race condition and a failed load.So we got promises. Honestly, for >90% of use cases, it just improved handling with then, catch, finally, etc. But it also enabled us to use Promise.all where we could cleanly write code, where we could call some nonsense like: function foo() { Promise.all([ getUserDropdownData(), getCityDropdownData(), getStateDropdownData(), getDepartmentDropdownData(), getSomeOtherData() ]) .then(values => { //doesn't execute until all of the above data is loaded const [userData, cityData, statedata, deptData, otherData] = values; buildUserDataDropdown(userData); buildCityDataDropdown(cityData); buildStateDataDropdown(stateData); buildDeptDataDropdown(deptData); buildOtherDataDropdown(otherData); }) .then(() => { //doesn't execute until we're done building all the dropdowns refreshTableData(); //...might have to add a 1ms timeout to grab default values accurately }) } /* disclaimer, I half tested this real quick with timeouts, may or may not work, example only */You would literally be tearing your eyes out to do that without promises; I'm talking 3-4x that many lines of code to sync all of it up. Also, with overhead, you might be waiting \~200ms for each request, so your drop-downs load in \~220ms instead of \~1000ms. Now we can cleanly make those requests in parallel without fear of race conditions, and request our table data even faster.We also got web workers; because Javascript is single-threaded it just executes whatever is at the top of the stack. If I have to do something that counts to...1 billion, that'll block the top of the stack while it counts, locking the rest of the page. If I assign it to a worker, the worker gets a separate thread from my main JS thread to do its task.And that's all I'm gonna say because I took way too long typing this.",Mike312,2025-12-16 08:45:09,9,learnprogramming,t3_1pnuj7k,False,
nub0kfo,"> Is multithreading considered “legacy” or risky now?Depends on the use case. Async doesn't help with CPU-bound work. Multithreading can.> Are async/event-driven models actually better for most scalable backends?Async is just a way to have a suspendable function. For backend, the theory is that we spend a lot of time waiting for slow IO. OS-provided threads tend to be heavyweight (e.g. every thread reserves memory for its call stack, and that tends to be O(MB) for each thread). So using them just to wait for slow IO is wasteful. If we instead move all that into userspace, we can avoid a lot of that overhead.> Or is this more about developer experience than performance?It's both, although async/await also has some downsides (mainly [the function coloring problem](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/)). Some languages / runtimes (like Erlang, Go, and Java) manage to avoid the function coloring problem.> A lot of blogs and talks make it sound like classic multithreading (threads, locks, shared state) is something people are actively trying to avoidI maintain that async is susceptible to many of the same issues that multithreaded code is susceptible to, but at a more coarse-grained level. If you have shared data that is being operated on by two in-flight `async` calls, then they will interleave with each other in unpredictable ways. You still want tools to e.g. block one async function from resuming while a different async function is busy updating some shared data.Because async/await has well-defined preemption points, you're not going to have a single memory location that is being read from and written to at the same time. But you _could_ be in the middle of updating a complex structure. Perhaps it's in an inconsistent state, but you need to call an async function before you can put it back in a consistent state. That's basically the same problem that exists in classical threading, with the same solution - you want something like a mutex.There's a reason that Go and Java (with virtual threads) both have mutex types, despite both supporting colorless async. Even then, you are encouraged to use higher-level tools if you can. But sometimes, you just need a mutex.",balefrost,2025-12-16 09:09:24,6,learnprogramming,t3_1pnuj7k,False,

Everything else is a guessing game :slightly_smiling_face:P.S. Forgot to say, it's worth trying to assess the flow of data in your application.

nu5vonj,"SQL injection happens when you are able to identify that the receiving application does not sanitize the user input or limit permissions levels before passing it to the database (application is what authenticates to the database, not the end user). Take the following as an example loophole. The common SQL injection came from login pages, meaning the application would accept a username and password from the end user, then will check the database for matching records.An example of a poor and vulnerable way to handle the input / login process would be something like`Select TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = '{input.username}' AND Password = '{input.password}';`then accepting the record returned as the 'authenticated' user. Now, lets look at how the resulting query would work for a normal input as well as a malicious input. Lets say I put in ""John@Doe.com"" as the username and ""RubberDucky"" as the password. The application would pass the following to the database`SELECT TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = 'John@Doe.com' AND Password = 'RubberDucky'`fair enough, now what happens if i put in a username of ""Admin';--""? The application would pass the following `SELECT TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = 'Admin';-- ' AND Password = 'RubberDucky';`The database will return the first user that has the username of ""Admin"" and consider it to be authenticated because ' will finish my string input, "";"" would terminate the SQL command, and ""--"" comments out the rest to prevent any kind of syntax errors. that is just a very basic example. Another example i found in production (i work for this company and had permission) was they created an API that would allow you to pass in a SQL query to generate custom reports and such (HORRIBLE IDEA btw). To make it ""secure"" they used pattern matching and prevented commands like ""UPDATE"", ""DELETE"", ""\*"", etc. So as a proof of concept, i encoded my query in b64 and passed in a query that would decode and execute it to create tables, dump SQL user names, dump stored CC info, etc. I have also seen people do it in HEX Once you start spotting potential holes like this, the possibilities are endless as to what you can do.

The front end then sends the name to the back end to retrieve the stats.Let's say the backend does an SQL query on the database like ""SELECT \* FROM Students WHERE Name = '$name'"".Normally this works great. But what if I type the following:Robert'; DROP TABLE Students;Now the SQL query on the backend looks like this:SELECT \* FROM Students WHERE Name = 'Robert'; DROP TABLE Students;When that is executed, it will search for Robert in the database, and then it will wipe all the data out.Of course you can do more advanced things other than deleting stuff in the database. You can add other queries to try to extract more information than the website would otherwise allow. You can probe the database for other tables, like maybe asking if there is a list of credit card numbers. You can get really fancy like querying to see if any columns start with the letter ""A"" or ""B"" or ""C"" and so on, and if you do enough of those queries you can reconstruct the schema for the database and discover all sorts of interesting things.I wrote a simple website one that had a shell injection vulnerability. It was a great way to learn, and I felt really dumb when someone pointed it out to me, but I'm super glad they did!

This will make the sql query return true, so the login will succeed when it should fail.There are lots of other issues with this code, but that is how SQL injection can work.

And that's where the application has access to the database. It uses a pool of connections that will just execute any command you give it.

There isn't much reason to worry about learning particularly languages at this point, but rather make sure you are learning the common fundamental concepts shared by all of them.There are jobs out there for pretty much any programming language, but being able to pick up new ones quickly is important. The requirements of the project usually dictate what language(s) might be best for the project. The knowledge already in a team also plays a big part. But people able to switch and learn new languages is a really common task.For an example, I applied for a job that used Ruby. I had no Ruby experience, but it took me less than a week (of non-intensive) practice to be able to get a job offer from them. I was even up-front that I had no professional Ruby experience. It really doesn't matter, because 95%+ of languages all share similar concepts, so switching between them is easy.For now, I wouldn't worry about it too much.

When you hit a bug, frame it as ""I'm going to figure this out"" rather than ""ugh this is broken.""

A queue behaves in a circular way because that’s what we need to do, on the machine level there is no circular behaviour, like i sais, data is just stacked like books on a table.To understand how do we create such behaviours out of memory slots and most importantly why, you need a low enough language to see what’s going under the hood, otherwise it will look like magic.

ntg7tky,"## ExpositionI'm a lot like you in the sense that I want to understand the ""full stack"" of every system I run across. For years it has got me glued to books on computer science and on general programming topics, chatting with AI about the subject, googling, watching YT videos, etc. It has helped me gain a good basis for how things work but it has also been a way for me to avoid the really hard job of coding itself.## The ProblemWithout getting too much into meditation and casual research I've done on psychology, the basic problem is this: It's not the subject matter - programming or computer science - *it's the response to that internal state while learning the subject matter*. You need ways to switch off that self-referential egotalk. It won't go away before you start treating it and other internal feelings and thoughts as ""information"" rather than realities that are playing out or describing ""who you are"". They are chemical events, some helpful, some unhelpful. The system that spawns them is full of messy, contradictory responses to these internal events that don't always make sense. Your brain has neuroplasticity, and whether you like it or not even your identity is a construction. Yes, we all have some properties like IQ and EQ that determine some speed or efficiency of function but again those don't determine binary outcomes. The real hindrance is the ego butting in when the analytical parts are trying to do their job or those parts tiring out.I've wired my brain to be lazy, inattentive and identify myself as stupid. The identity itself and the thoughts surrounding it is a learned set of patterns. That wiring can change, the feelings it produces while under stress can change and my image of myself can change but they won't unless I keep allowing my brain to default to those pathways and don't offer it new experiences and responses to certain difficult stimuli.## The Realities of the FieldThe feeling of not knowing something or being confused will never change in this field. Your conscious response to that can and that will ultimately lead to your brain interpreting those signals differently. You'll even start to love the challenge of not knowing, if you can get out of your own way.## What to focus on - the narrow approach**Your real goal is learning to understand systems, syntax and data.** There are easier and harder approaches to this but generally I'd say **try to learn how memory works**. And learn it robustly. Study the virtual memory system, study file systems, study how different information - audio, text, graphics, device state - get modeled in memory. While there are millions of libraries, protocols and file formats, they have to all converge on the simple core truth of writing bytes to or reading bytes from memory. If you can nail this layer, write a few parsers that interpret file formats or networking protocols, you'll get a solid grasp of the simple fact that **software is just agreed upon patterns of bytes**. This won't trivialize learning libraries but it will trivialize a certain notion of ""newness"" from them - they aren't anything new. They may sit at several levels lower or higher on the software stack but they are all still just memory. ## On AI Resources are sometimes hard to come by but AI is actually pretty good for this. As long as you aren't copying code but rather asking questions on subjects that are stable and unlikely to change - how things in computer science, and the technologies that express it, work - you can get very good, very detailed answers. Plus you can go back and forth with it, trying to nail and refine your understanding. It's like taking notes with a tutor.## ConclusionSo don't be like me. Don't rush. Accept discomfort. Accept being stupid and having to ask. Think of the skill acquisition portion like laying bricks on a giant wall. You wish for a fast and glorious end result, you'll even settle for ""100 more bricks laid out today, look at that progress!"" but what you need and what you get by showing up and working every day is that one brick.

Since you like web development and you know basic Java you have all the makings of a full stack developer.By building projects to learn how to develop software the concepts you learn in school will make more sense how it applies. School does not really teach you how to develop software directly so you are going to have to learn this on your own in addition to what they teach in school.Start small and keep simple and add one small thing at a time. Work from frontend to backend to database for every feature you add. Let the projects you pick guide what you need to learn when you need to learn it.This might sound crazy to some, but the often dismissed TODO application is very well suited for teaching comprehensive full stack development. You just have to take it that far.Here is an example roadmap that could keep you busy for a while.Start small, create an index.html page that has the word ""hello"" on it. This is where I always start after 30+ years of doing this :) Next, add the next small thing, probably the proper html scaffolding. Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.Make TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack. Fill in the rest of the REST/CRUD stuff.Now for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.Do this with every small project you work on. A calculator, an address book, a small online store, an invoice payment processing system, inventory management system. The skills you learn from taking TODO the whole nine yards will give you the skills you need to build any of these.I hope this helps.",Ok_Substance1895,2025-12-13 23:00:28,1,learnprogramming,t3_1pl8v9k,False,

nu9zyvl,"The basic idea is: every program consists of objects that have properties and do things. Sometimes they interact with each other. Sometimes they even make more objects.Then there are four ""pillars"": encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.1. Encapsulation is when an object's properties are hidden to the public, and optionally only exposed through some kind of filter. These are most commonly seen as `get` and `set` methods.2. Inheritance is when one type of object is a ""subclass"" of another (""superclass""), so every property and method of the latter also belongs to the former. 3. Abstraction is when you hide the internals of how something works, and just expose the inputs and outputs. This is far from exclusive to OOP; chances are you're already used to this. 4. Polymorphism is when you refer to the same object using different types to get different information from it. In the same ""subclass"" relationship used for inheritance, every object of type subclass is also of type superclass.That's it, that's OOP!

Some people have learned the ""single return"" style and stick with that.Others prefer the ""return early to handle error conditions"" style, which has its advantages.Most people seem to miss that the two styles are not mutually exclusive. It's certainly possible to handle errors early without an early return. Though, it usually means that we need to do one of two ""not nice"" things stylistically: (a) we need to increase indentation for the non-error case, or (b) we need to use a goto at the error point (or throw an exception), which many people find not nice, but rarely say the explicit reason for their aversion to it.In your particular example that you cited, the early return is not really an ""error case"", though, so in this particular example, placing both the returns at the same indentation level (i.e. one within in the ""if"" branch and the other within the ""else"" branch) would make the \*intent\* slightly clearer.Now, suppose you wanted to amend the function and include some kind of ""error condition"" like for the value 0 (which is mathematically neither even nor odd). In such a case like that, then in my opinion it would be clearer to use an early return for that, since doing so ""idiomatically"" expresses the idea that this kind of situation is an unexpected or unusual case. I.e., maybe the caller made some kind of mistake by asking whether 0 is even or odd, because logically that may make no sense, so maybe it's a mistake that it was asked.Once the ""error returns"" are taken care of, the rest of the code can basically assume (correctly) that the value in question is ""correct"" in terms of logicality.

What happens if an email address doesn't match the ""`isValidEmailAddress`"" check?It's a bit easier to read, both in terms of lowering mental strain and indenting depth, if you take simple cases and pull them out like this: // Try to guess the user's first name, return a generic name if it can't be inferred String guessFirstNameFromEmail(String emailAddress) { if (!isValidEmailAddress(emailAddress)) { return ""Alex""; } if (username == """") { return ""Sam""; } if (username.contains(""."")) { return username.split(""."")[0]; } if (hasUpperAndLowerLetterMix(username)) { return username.splitBy(SplitMethod.CapitalLetters)[0]; } return username; }In the lower case, it's more of a series of deductions - you're considering your assumptions first, and it reads more like getting ""weird"" cases out of the way first (bad input, empty string, etc...).",sessamekesh,2025-12-17 09:03:30,3,learnprogramming,t3_1poqy8r,False,

E.g.: def fizzbuzz(number: int) -> str: result = """" if number % 3 == 0: result += ""Fizz"" if number % 5 == 0: result += ""Buzz"" if result == """": result = str(number) return result In this example you could return the final value both in the second and third if-statement, but if you change the function and a third condition like ```if number % 7 == 0: result += ""Razz""```then you would have to also change the statement in the Buzz-branch even though your change had nothing to do with the Buzz part of the logic.",Achereto,2025-12-17 08:43:40,2,learnprogramming,t3_1poqy8r,False,

At some point you will find a value that you weren’t expecting and you can figure out why it got the value it got and fix it. An alternate approach is to work backwards.

ntnmubf,"Former game developer here,Focus on your comp-sci and maths. Ditch the game-dev courses.Back in the day, there were two schools that offered a game-dev degree; they were DigiPen, and Full Sail. Both these schools are accredited, both these schools are collaborations WITH THE GAME INDUSTRY. The CEOs of both EA-US and Sony-US sat on the direction board of Full Sail.Around 2006, we were at the height of Sallie Mae robbing the American public blind, and ALL the universities got in on it. They fed peoples delusions of grandeur back to them, and offered game-dev degrees of their own. I sat on a couple review boards myself, and I'd name and shame if I wasn't going to get sued to oblivion if I did... They're robbing people blind. These programs are designed without any industry input or representation whatsoever.And by 2010, the game studios had fully reacted. These days, they don't want to HEAR ""game dev"" degree, because they know you won't know comp-sci to save your life, and you won't know game dev, either. There's still a certain respect for the two schools mentioned, but for the most part, they want a traditional comp-sci degree.In the mid 20-teens, the Department of Education started cracking down - tying federal grant money and subsidies to both graduation rates and placement success. Ineffective programs became dangerous to schools and they had to start putting up or shutting up.Well, I can promise you MOST of the schools slip through the cracks, and this current administration has declared war on education and dissolved the DoE. So I don't know WHAT you're learning over there...And if you're outside the US, I'd trust your game-dev education even less. If the program isn't perfectly cohesive, that's a really, really bad sign.Sorry to burst your bubble, sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but at the very least, it's not too late to turn your future prospects around. Get in on math classes, as much as you can from here on out.As for how your interview is going to go when you present yourself to a game studio - it's going to be almost exclusively math oriented. They're going to drill you on linear algebra, calculus, and physics at the very least. Some of it will be comp-sci oriented about algorithms, some of it will be physics, some of it will be rendering, some of it is used in game dev but you'll have never seen before because they just want to see how well you adapt to new maths - that you haven't just memorized everything. They're going to grill you over this. As for any programming part of the interview, mostly they just want to know that you know enough syntax to be dangerous: reverse a string, write a linked list.Hell, you don't need C++ specifically in your education. Java is almost indiscernible from C#, which itself is used heavily in game dev, and they all share common syntax and idioms. You can pick up enough C++ on your own to get by.The studio can teach you good programming on the job, they can't teach you math and how to think.",mredding,2025-12-12 15:11:52,1,learnprogramming,t3_1pknqzc,False,

The whole creative process has more steps than just laying down lines of code. Planning it, packaging it, deploying it so others can use it, are just as important.Simple games are a good choice, because they're inherently useful: people play them for fun. Sure, you can learn another language. But, if you do a couple of projects first, you'll get more out of your effort to learn that new language.Also, it has to be said, in your programming career you will probably need to learn new languages or othe major tech at least a dozen times.

You can do all of this in python too it'll just be 50% more difficult than js, but python has better support for complex data and more and different external packages.

You would find it on your 4th iteration and return true.Let's say you wanted to do binary search instead So first step, you cut the array in half. N / 2 = 2.5, so we just pick index 2.There's a 3 there, which isn't what we want. So we compare if it's higher or lower than 4.Since 3 is lower than 4, and we know the array is sorted, then we know that 4 is in the right half of the array[4 5]. Now, N = 2So you cut the array in half again. N/2 = 1, and at index 1, there's the number 5. It's higher than 4, so we have to cut in half again[4]Now there's only one element, and it's the number we want, so we return true.You will see that we had to cut the array in half only 3 times before we found it.Binary search has complexity O(log N) because the number of times we need to iterate with respect to the magnitude of the input (in this case, the number of elements in the array) is log (base 2) of N The things that are important when it comes to big O runtime complexity is to1. Identify how you're measuring the input2. Draw out each step of the algorithm3. Determine the amount of steps you would have in the worst case.For linear search, the worst case is having to check every element. So given N elements, you perform N iterations.In the case of binary search, since you're cutting the number of elements to search in half every iteration, you only need search log(base 2) N times, plus the one if there are odd number of elements.",mxldevs,2025-12-14 18:02:02,0,learnprogramming,t1_nu078lc,False,

Run it on GitHub Pages so now it is on the Internet too. Good stuff to learn to get that far. Then add the next small thing by adding a backend server and modify your TODO application to POST tasks there instead. POST, GET, UPDATE, DELETE are REST verbs you can learn about. Just print the tasks to the console for now. Once you have that working add a database and save a POSTed task to the database using SQL. INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE are SQL statements that map directly to the REST verbs and they are often referred to as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Fill in the GET (SELECT) request to retrieve your tasks, the UPDATE, then DELETE. Now your application is full stack.Let the projects you pick guide what you need to learn, when you need to learn it. MDN is a great resource for the frontend and there are many great resources for whatever backend and database you choose.As you build this, you are doing all of this locally, frontend, backend, database, and committing changes to git and pushing those changes to your GitHub repo as you go. To get your GitHub Pages frontend to talk to your backend running on your local machine you can learn about CORS (allows your frontend to talk to your backend) to add that to your backend then use \`ngrok\` to temporarily expose your server and port to the internet (only works while \`ngrok\` and your computer are running).Now that you have a full stack application running on the Internet, time to learn about authentication to make it so only registered users can access your server. You will add login/logout to your frontend and backend as well as user management. More REST and CRUD stuff to add for that too.Cloud stuff is next to get all of it running on the internet. That is a later topic.Whatever projects you pick, build projects as completely as you can. Make them full stack if that is your thing. Take TODO and add subscriptions/payments, member management, calendar schedules, email/sms reminders, single-sign on, SaaS deployment (cloud), whatever else you can think of.

Formal programming education is basically non existent before University.All you have is the *documentation manual* for the programming language.How do you learn?Through experimentation. You have no resources, so the only thing you can do is play around, try things. Fail. Try more. Fail again. Try more and eventually succeed.You won't learn by copying tutorial or stackoverflow, etc. code. You will only learn by creating your own code, even if that means that your solutions are maybe complicated, convoluted, and sub-optimal. Yet, they are *your* solutions. They stem from *your thought process*. This way, you *learn*.Once you have a working solution, there is no harm in looking up how others have solved the problems. This way, you can learn better, more optimized approaches. Yet, first *you* need to figure out a solution.The notion of directly looking for solutions via the internet is detrimental to learning, even more so in the current age of permanent availability of the internet, and worse, with the advent of AI. It makes us lazy. It makes us stopping to think analytically. It makes us stop investing effort, because ""why should we when everything is readily available?"". In return, it makes us stop actually *learning*. Learning means struggling. Learning means failing. Learning means debugging. Learning does not mean getting a solution from effectively a third party (no matter if Google, Stackoverflow, AI, etc.)Discipline yourself to not looking for direct solutions and even less *in code*, but to look for *approaches* to solutions. Maybe, download the documentation for your programming language and then cut yourself off the internet. Seems like a radical step, but can be extremely helpful for learning.The thought process from problem to solution is what really counts in programming, not the *implementation* in a programming language (that's the more trivial part and just a necessary evil).Once you understand how to ""think like a programmer"" things change considerably. Programming languages become less important and you learn to work on a more abstract, conceptional level.Maybe, try some programming competitions, like [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) (with the accompanying subreddit /r/adventofcode) - current year is over, but the challenges are all accessible back to the very first season in 2015. Another recommendable site is [Exercism](https://exercism.org). Here, you get challenges and have ""hints"" and guidance.As usual with such posts (of which there are more than plenty), some Literature (aka *books*):+ ""Think Like A Programmer"" by V. Anton Spraul+ ""The Pragmatic Programmer"" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas+ ""Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman+ ""Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software"" by Charles PetzoldTo address your ""all coders do is just copy-paste"" statement: yes, we do copy paste, but not because we *could not do the job*, it's because of time constraints, trusted and tested solutions. Contrary to a beginner/learner, we can assess what a solution copied from the internet does, how it fits into our codebase, what side effects it has, etc. We could come up with our own solutions, but that would be less efficient in a professional setting than to resort to tested and trusted solutions.",aqua_regis,2025-12-15 10:24:10,15,learnprogramming,t3_1pmzjoe,False,

nts5phs,"I could be wrong, I've never worked with gmpy2, but I believe this is what's happening:`x` and `y` are never covered to gmpy2 types here, you are relying on the library to either handle the regular Python `int` and `float` types or create temporary gmpy2 type objects from them in order to do the math. The results of those functions will be gmpy2 types, but nowhere does any of this replace `x` and `y` with an equivalent gmpy2 type. This matters.The source code for gmpy2 might help understand why.`qdiv` source is [here](https://github.com/gmpy2/gmpy2/blob/master/src/gmpy2_mpq_misc.c#L162).You can skip to line 210 since the first part is if you use it with only 1 argument.The check for whether your arguments are valid is this: if (!IS_RATIONAL(x) || !IS_RATIONAL(y)) { goto arg_error; }`IS_RATIONAL` is a macro defined in [gmpy2_convert.h](https://github.com/gmpy2/gmpy2/blob/master/src/gmpy2_convert.h#L54)The function works for `mpq`, `mpz`, `xmpz`, Python's `Fraction`, `int` types, and types with the `__mpq__` or `__mpz__` conversion functions (these are for writing your own custom classes, they do not get added to existing types like `float`, so they aren't relevant here).`int` is in the list, so the argument `x` is ok, but `float` is not in that list, and `y` is a `float`, so that check fails.I believe if you write `print(test(4, gmpy2.mpq(2.0)))` this should work. The reason `qdiv` does not work on regular floating point numbers. `mpq` numbers are similar to `Decimal` or `Fraction` types in Python, storing a numerator and denominator, and as far as I'm aware they're always stored fully simplified, so `2.0` = 2/1, so as long as both arguments are integers in any of the supported types, the division operation should be simple integer division for which they have a highly optimized algorithm. Dividing by a float however is not that simple, and converting a standard `float` into `mpq` is additional work. `qdiv` is an optimized function that's trying to avoid doing unnecessary work, so it simply says ""no, you can't do this"".Because it doesn't do any unnecessary work, `qdiv` is faster, but the price is that it's more restrictive about when it can be used. If you are trying to learn this library, you should be explicitly creating variables using the gmpy2 types rather than relying on the functions to work with regular Python types and do the conversions for you when necessary.",Bobbias,2025-12-13 07:37:06,4,learnprogramming,t3_1plaqc8,False,

I don't know, I'm still working on it.Anyways, `print(test(4, gmpy2.mpq(2.0)))` does work, but for my purposes with this code, in this example, I'll probably just take the input of a normal float 2.0 for y, and then convert it to mpz in the function.",cton999,2025-12-13 17:11:26,1,learnprogramming,t1_nts5phs,True,
ntu2xnv,"Thank you for your insight. I guess that makes sense in a way. gmpy2.is\_integer() is checking whether the *value* of a number is equivalent to an integer, but gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) needs numbers with the *type* of integer.I don't think it's a bug *now*, but the way gmpy2.is\_integer() is described in the gmpy2 docs seems kind of misleading? On the page for Multiple Precision Reals: is\_integer() → bool: Return True if x is an integer; False otherwise. Does gmpy2.is\_integer() say that it only checks value as opposed to type somewhere in the docs and I just missed it?I'm not a professional programmer by any means, but maybe the description for gmpy2.is\_integer() should include that it checks only if the value is equivalent to an integer, not type? Or maybe there should be a method in gmpy2 to check type, like the normal python isinstance? I think it'd be reasonable to think that if you saw that if is\_integer returns True if x is an integer, and used gmpy2.is\_integer() to check if something was an integer and it returned True, that it would be considered an integer while utilizing gmpy2.Anyways, ""There’s little reason to try to use qdiv in your test code"". I'm testing qdiv and gmpy2 in general because I plan to use it on other code that I'm working on that can use arbitrarily large numbers where you could set the inputs to just be integers, and I read that gmpy2 is great for large numbers and qdiv is faster than div.I was testing inputs for various arithmetic with gmpy2 and that's how I ran into this ""whole number"" float ""problem"". It's not a problem for me to use python's isinstance function and/or use gmpy2's integer types like mpz.

ntvocb8,"That would work fine, although if you were writing real code rather than just testing things you probably want all your numbers to be in the gmpy2 types pretty much as soon as possible. Like if you were reading data from a file or user input, you should ideally convert them right away so that you ensure any math being done on them is done through the gmpy2 functions.From my understanding gmpy2 can handle converting types very well, even converting directly from strings (so you wouldn't need to first convert input from a file or user to `int` or `float` before converting to gmpy2 types).Additionally, I believe `mpq` can be converted to `mpz` as long as `is_integer` is true. I'm curious what you intend to use this for. From my understanding you'd need to be doing some pretty heavy math in order to justify using gmpy2, and there are other packages which might be a better fit depending on exactly what you're planning on doing. Packages like Pandas/Polars, Numpy, SciPy, etc. all implement their math internals in C or other compiled languages too.",Bobbias,2025-12-13 21:43:18,2,learnprogramming,t1_ntua9xy,False,

Although these are only statistics for Ontario, I have no reason to believe that the same would not be happening elsewhere; I doubt there's anything special about these statistics compared to any others.

There's no one breathing down your neck while you problem-solve. The time pressure, high stakes, and interviewers disrupting your thought process aren't simulated.

Even as a jr, document everything you do. Just finished a big project? Most jobs use a documentation system where you can just look up how to do things.

nue3wly,"I can explain since I work with a said “Good Software Engineer” currently. I’ve been at my current position (my first one since outside of college) for about a year and 10 months give or take. From working there so far, I have worked with two really good engineers. Both of them have had two totally different experiences, but surprisingly, both have ended up in the same place doing the exact same thing. One of them was a self taught developer who tinkered with programming at a young age and learned many languages. Unfortunately, he didn’t pursue a CS degree because he grew up very poor but is in the works of getting one right now. This dude had many personal projects under his belt and worked extensively outside of work getting tasks at work completed. He had around 15 years of experience working with software and loved programming. He knew embedded programming really well too including how PLCs work and loved learning new things about programming. The other had a CE degree from Michigan Tech and has around 15 years of experience. He worked with embedded programming for the bulk of his career at GE Aviation. He really enjoys learning about new technologies and currently is helping us bring into the modern era an older application. This dude is my current mentor and has taught me so much in terms of how to program and ultimately, how to go about architecting and designing programs. He is a monster, he designed a completely new product from an older application at my company and reverse engineered the way it works so that it translated properly to a new language and environment. My coworkers had told him that the old project was a mess since it was written with a very old version of C++ (to most of us it was a mess lol). But he straight up in the interview said “nothing scared him”. My bosses laughed at him but he proved US ALL wrong. The thing about both of them that made them really good engineers was that both of them explicitly stated to me that all they did was “breathe and live” code. They programmed on all their free time and worked many hours outside of the usual 40 hour work week perfecting their craft. They read books, watched videos, they absorbed so much information on their free time that it clearly showed when they came into work ready to start their day. Like I feel helpless sometimes just seeing that they can take on so many tasks (especially tough ones) and my tasks I complete are mediocre at best. But the thing is, I am absorbing the knowledge they give to me.

nu20qch,"Idk, I never struggled to find a job either… until this year. Always had backlogs of recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn, even though I never posted/updated/said I was looking for work. I think there’s a few factors at play that make the job market seem extra shitty right now.1. Layoffs/hiring freezes across big tech, and government jobs. Basically a large pool of people who would have been considered ‘Top Talent’ a few years ago are now all looking for work at once. The longer they are unemployed, the lower the standards get, so even if you are just applying for ‘Regular’ jobs, a few of the 100+ resumes in that inbox probably has ‘Google’ or ‘Meta’ or whatever on it. 2. With AI, it’s become trivial to spam out resumes, and tailor/frame your work experience to the exact job requirements. If you just earnestly apply to jobs, you are unlikely to get an interview even if you are a relatively good fit. You said ‘SQL’ on your resume. Someone else mentioned the exact distribution they use at the company. You said ‘AWS’ they said the exact AWS features and tech stack being used. Often times your resume won’t even make it past the screening stage.3. Just general hiring trends. Hiring tends to be forward looking, so I think a lot of senior leadership is really leaning into the idea that they should be able to accomplish more with the same amount of people. Instead of increasing headcount by 10% for some new project, they’ll try to push AI tools and re-org the ‘freed up’ employees to whatever new project they are working on.It’s definitely pretty rough. Even with 8+ years of backend dev and Data Science experience, I’ve applied to ~100+ jobs. One final round of interviews, no job offers, and I only got there because I had a referral. I’ve started just not bothering with jobs that list even one specific technology I don’t have experience with.I’m not saying I’m a super talented top dev. I’ve always worked at middle of the road non tech F500 companies. But I’ve never been fired or even had a bad performance review. I’d be so excited to just get the feedback ‘Yo, you didn’t do a good job solving this LC problem. Or your architecture skills and thought process isn’t what we are looking for’. But it’s just like… no one even gives you a chance to interview if you don’t BS your resume with AI. Then those are the pool of people you can hire, and the quality of the hiring goes down.",IAmBoredAsHell,2025-12-14 22:23:03,22,cscareerquestions,t3_1pmqfir,False,

Location is a major factor.In markets like New York or Silicon Valley, you have people who have sacrificed years of their lives to prep for demanding positions, so every role that gets posted has a ton of competition. When candidates get dumped onto the market from layoffs, companies have to ratchet up the difficulty in interviews just to have a manageable pipeline.I've been involved in the recruiting for a team that is not in a tech hub. In-person work is a hard requirement, for about \~150k base salary, no stocks, no bonus. It's probably average for that area, but not particularly attractive for someone to move just for the job. We even offer relocation assistance for that role.We get maybe 20 candidates per job posting, half of which are not qualified because they need sponsorship. If we interview 10 people, about 1/2 can actually write a basic loop. We hire whoever has the best systems design interview since most people can not clear even a LeetCode easy. (clear rate for a fully passing solution is probably about 5% of all candidates that reach that stage).I really think unemployed engineers who are having trouble securing an offer for months have the wrong strategy. They should be taking up these 'easy' low paying jobs, moving temporarily, and then continuing to interview for their hotshot Big Tech and Silicon Valley roles.

nu2ua2e,"Dev quality has always been a mixed bag. College is notoriously bad at delivering industry ready devs and the job itself takes a certain broken sort of mind. Then you had boot camps generating devs that could do one thing okay quickly. Many devs don’t have cs degrees and a lot of those guys are actually pretty solid. The tech has gotten increasingly complex. The output expectations have increased. The quality of peers has declined. Interview intensity has gone way up. There is the expectation now that ai just makes it all happen magically and that we will be eliminated soon anyways. Dollar is worth less. There was a time you could be good at one part of the stack and be paid well. Now the expectation is your good at fe, be, observability, continuous integration, testing, deployment, wireframes, reqs & documentation, etc. It used to be if the codebase was a mess or you weren’t familiar with some framework they would cut you slack of train you but less so now. It used to be a few devs in a room working through stuff. Now everyone’s remote on different continents crammed into tiny noisy apartments. You’re still supposed to manage to mentor them.  Usually most of the team has already been outsourced so they really don’t have the same skin in the game and your heads on the chopping block. The interview used to focus on your degree, likability, location, and experience.  It went from white boarding to take home test and live coding exams to leet code with ai graders kidding your voice and eye movements. Not to mention how everything’s flooded now so getting noticed / not getting duped leading up to the interview view is harder. The expectation of 2x ai productivity doesn’t account for the quality of the ai, existing code, or clarity of instructions. Then there is pay. It’s held strong in a way and even grown faster than other industries but the dollar is worth under 1/3 as much as ten years ago in terms of shelter, transportation, healthcare, and food. Then there’s the increase in domestic cs degrees coming online and the over hiring in the covid market rally which went to layoffs then to ai hiring. I’ve had 6 jobs in ten years and everyone has laid us off or been bought out. Some were productive, some kept the companies software alive, others had no idea what they wanted. Can definitely make you tired. But that’s why it’s a job, right? Made some money. Am I a fool for thinking I would still be hustling 25 years from now or not gambling my cash into the stonks? Probably… Out of work and just been studying for a few months.

ntlghzm,"Just for a different perspective:I remember that first year out of uni as also very stressful and draining. I felt that I knew very little, the culture was kinda weird, there were some big egos and seasoned jaded ultra senior devs that kinda left a trail of bitterness in the air. Competition, devs being passive aggresive, putting down each other, one upping each other. I didnt know it for the first year, but that company was very unprofessional and amateurish even though quite successful and big. It was a software company developing b2b solutions. After a while I noticed I was sitting with the same stack, same flows, almost the same user stories all the time. I felt like I was living groundhog day and definitely thought I made a huge mistake choosing this career. I realised I cant be working on the same product for 20 years. And I thought all dev jobs were gonna be like this and I had no ther skills.After almost 2 years I couldnt take it anymore, I needed to get out. I also, much like you, wanted to pivot immediately. The easiest transition and most obvious solution for me was consultancy. I first joined a tech consultancy firm and the atmosphere change was night and day. Suddenly it was in their best interest to get me official certifications (they can sell you better to clients if you have a shiny cv), so it felt like being back at uni a bit, with studying for exams etc.After that, I got to work with a lot of different projects for different clients in different industries. The projects would be anything from delivering an MVP within 6 months internally for a client/company A to being placed as a dev on site and joining the team at client/company B - contracts could range from 6 months to a year and could always be extended or if things didnt work out my manager would pull me out earlier. It was the BEST experience because I got to work wkth very many different people that taught me loads.Unfortunately, change in management + politics and the economy suddenly dried up the assignment pipeline and I was left on the bench for way too long. I decided to jump ship. I now work at a non-tech financial firm as part of their internal tech team. My team develops solutions for our non tech employees around the globe. This means many projects, some small, some big with many different focuses and tech stacks. I work primarily with people that studied computer science as a minor and kinda fell into development by chance. My role is to help professionalise their solutions. And I love it. I am not surrounded by tech mentality at all... its just finance and law. A nightmare for any brogrammer that yearns for silly valley and definitely not without its pain points. But for me its the best of both worlds, cos im still in tech, actively coding and architecting but the expectations are way lower, theres competition between finance bro and finance bro, but that doesnt affect me. Finance bros have to work Christmas but we do not, in fact we shouldn't really develop or ship anything during that time cos getting new update before year close makes finance bros very nervous haha. And now with AI in the air, our teams budget got increased, and we are encouraged to find novel ways to help make the firms employees more efficient/productive. That means a lot of autonomy to explore new tech stacks and solutions. It is genuinely fun again. A bit chaotic, but without the stress and expectation of greatness. Anyway... Just wanted to say theres better things out there. And that tech doesnt have to be too techy. Theres a light on the other side.",forgetitok,2025-12-12 05:03:01,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1pk8p88,False,

nu4kaw5,"If another developer’s actions create obstacles that make your work more difficult, it is reasonable to raise those obstacles with your manager or whoever can address them. The focus should stay on the obstacle that is blocking you, not on the developer as a person.This framing positions you as someone trying to improve results for the company by identifying obstacles, rather than as someone “reporting” on a coworker. It avoids unnecessary interpersonal conflict and reduces the risk of backlash if your manager interprets it as a personal complaint.If the other developer’s behavior does not produce obstacles that actually impede your work, it is usually best to ignore it. Spending time and energy evaluating another person’s work habits is a distraction from producing strong results yourself.**Responding to your edit:** you’re saying that when your coworkers don’t do their work, you end up working overtime and feeling pressure to meet deadlines. That overtime and deadline pressure is the real obstacle being created by their lack of follow-through.That’s understandably frustrating. The right response is to communicate clearly with your manager about project status and work allocation. When work is assigned but not completed, you should state that the project is off track, explain that tasks are being reallocated, and explicitly note either that you are working overtime to meet deadlines or that deadlines will slip as a result of the reallocation.This gives your manager the opportunity to recognize and credit your extra effort, or to see that deadlines are being missed because work isn’t getting done and needs to be reassigned. Ideally, this leads them to independently notice that a particular coworker is consistently not completing their work.If your manager does not acknowledge your overtime and instead simply pressures you to work harder, then the issue is poor management.

Regarding brand name, prestige, network, I will say this: generally no employer cares about an MS degree for a software engineer, so what you learn and do with it matters a lot more than what goes in the education section of your resume.

I should probably say ""if"" rather than ""until."" Large organizations also go through something like this, so don't feel too self-conscious. Is there are larger tech community/team in your company? A part of me wants to say you should ask about joining them, but the new manager might be a pain. You should consider looking for other opportunities, as you're probably not learning good software practices. To counter that, perhaps you can allocate time for process improvement. You can sell it as ways to allow others to do your work. So, things like version control (I hope you're already using this, right?), CI/CD, some type of wiki for documentation, a ticketing/tracking system are some good starts. Maybe some next things to consider is how do you monitor things in Production? Just look at log files? I also want to clarify something. Just because a company has this stuff in place doesn't mean they do a good job with it. During the interview process, it's on you to try to figure out if places do a good job or not. Good luck, as some places will flat out lie to you. My last job is an example. The tech leads did everything, and the people on the management side didn't do much work outside of call names during daily standups. They certainly didn't understand any of the work from a business perspective.

You'll grow a really large network of other early stage engineers really quickly and when everyone inevitably scatters within 3-5 years you'll have that network at a lot of other tech companies as a result.I will say, the work is a mixed bag. For one of my rotations I was a data analyst and it was the most boring thing on earth (old school SAP WEBI work). For the other I was building ML models in Azure which was a lot better (I stuck with that rotation post tdp). I think the biggest downside is that the pay stagnates super hard post TDP if you dont end up in a good title. Some of my friends came out as senior software engineers around 140k, others (like me) came out with much less glamorous titles doing roughly the same work at 110k. Pay disparity was just a function of what business unit you ended up in and what titles that business unit would allow.

Do they use cloud orchestration in any way or IAC?I'd recommend getting your AWS Developer Associate cert. I went from zero interviews to weekly interviews once I got that.If you aren't getting interviews though, it's because your resume is weak. How do you list your skills? What skills are listed? Are you tailoring each resume to each application? Stop applying and build up your resume.Reaching out to alumni is a waste imo. You should network locally, which will take at least 6 months imo to build up.

Once you start landing interviews, that's a whole other thing you gotta hone in, being able to explain things, understand things conceptually, know when to use what vs another...

I'd personally find it hard to justify using k8s / preferring availability just for this. Also, a core principle of SRE is having an error budget that you want to actually spend (i.e. having services that are \*too\* reliable is \*bad\*). I'd be a bit apprehensive to hire a senior whose recommendation is ""reliability at the cost of everything else"".## Too much human reliance""A justification in the PR, and/or""Personally, not a big fan of answers that boils down to ""let humans do this X process"". Humans are faulty, and manual processes tend to get ignored over time (e.g. people just rubber-stamping the justification).""At each stage, monitor:""This also seems like an extra toil that can be done automatically.In general, adding more bureucracy / slowing down development for the sake of needless reliability is also bad, similar to above.## Seems pretty textbookOverall, your answers give me the vibe of ""recommend the commonly recommended thing, just because that's best practice, without further thought"", like immediately jumping to k8s, specific DB, and so on.In the system design interview, I think I'd personally like to see how you think from the fundamentals and the first principle more, rather than just giving me a list of technologies immediately:- For a simple webapp, do we \*really\* need to use k8s? You're signing up your team to eat a lot of dev / knowledge cost before even hearing the full constraint of the problem.- Before jumping into the details, why not verify more fundamental things? e.g. do we need redundancy across different regions?- NoSQL theoretically scales horizontally better, but is that true in reality? In a lot of cases, there is a mismatch between theory and reality. Similar to how linked list are faster than arrays on paper for some use case, but they tend to be slower in reality due to caching performance.## Random nit'“What’s the default port for a web service?” and I answered 8080.' Incorrect? I'd expect the answer to be 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS. I'd personally shrug it as nervousness / misunderstanding, but maaaaybe there's a small chance of interviewers really disliking it (e.g. ""this person has only ever deployed things on localhost"") since that's a pretty fundamental thing to get wrong.Don't beat yourself up too much though, interview fails sometimes do just happen randomly (e.g. there just happen to be unicorn candidate right after you). From the post, it seems like you're a pretty strong candidate and the interview itself went pretty well.I think the core of the issue is that a senior SRE should be someone who knows why we need to follow mainstream recommendations, and when we should not follow them. I'm not saying you don't have that quality, but I think the way you answer the interview questions did not necessarily demonstrate that due to the textbook answer and overemphasis on reliability above all.",4m_33s,2025-12-11 07:14:56,9,cscareerquestions,t3_1pjlsx3,False,

One enhancement: frame your debugging narrative around measurable outcomes. Instead of just ""add alerts,"" try ""implement alerts on CrashLoopBackOff with a threshold of X failures in Y minutes, reducing MTTR by Z%."" Concrete metrics make your experience more verifiable and demonstrate production impact.For system design—your answers were directionally correct. The feedback about being more concrete is key. When discussing rate limiting or scaling strategies, reference specific implementations you've actually built or studied. ""In a previous project, I implemented X pattern which handled Y req/s"" is stronger than theoretical answers.

The market for new grads has just been brutal, especially if you didn’t get a return offer lined up before graduating.Going into IT is a totally reasonable move if you treat it as a bridge, not a dead end. GeekSquad + Network+ + cloud certs can absolutely move you toward DevOps or SRE if you keep one foot in software. Plenty of people have gone IT → sysadmin → DevOps once they could show scripting, automation, and cloud work.The key is to not stop building or talking like an engineer. Keep shipping small projects, automate stuff at work if you can, write scripts, mess with CI/CD, cloud deployments, monitoring. That’s what makes the transition believable later. If you fully pivot away from coding for a few years, it’s harder to come back.Also, you’re doing a lot right already. Hackathons, freelance, startup, networking, referrals, interviews. The lack of offers isn’t because you’re weak, it’s just timing and competition. IT can give you income, experience, and momentum while the market recovers.One thing I’ve learned is that interviews reward people who can clearly explain what they’ve built and why. During interviews I’ve used StealthCoder to keep my thoughts structured on screen so I don’t undersell myself or blank, especially when my path isn’t “traditional.” That helps when you’re coming from IT or mixed backgrounds.Short answer: yes, IT can be a smart move if you’re intentional about it.

My opinion.At the beginning of your career, you're pretty much like every other CS grad, a big lump of clay that they have to teach and mold. You might get a few more $$$ due to the higher education, but not enough to offset the extra 2 years and expense of getting the MS over the Bachelor's.At the middle of your career, for dev jobs they're mainly interested in your tech experience and what you can do. They don't want the lump of clay anymore, they want the refined tool for their tech stack or subject matter / industry. So for basic dev jobs most would rather hire a person with the right experience than somebody who's never done the work they're doing but who has a Masters. Which is when you try to get promoted.For companies / leaders that are credential-focused, you'll be more of a promotion target. With the MS-CS, that's team lead or architect. With an MBA, that's management. Whether or not you're deserving of those roles is another question, but for companies or leaders who focus on credentials, you'll move ahead of peers who lack them. At the end of your career, that mid-career trajectory bears fruit.So the question is, what path do you want? If you don't know -- and it's OK that you don't know, job experience will help you figure this out -- then I'd skip the Masters for now. Because you can always get it (or an MBA) later.In \~26 years in this industry, I've never seen a person with a Masters stand out so much that I wondered why and then discovered that they had a Masters.

I can't say a banger cover letter has ever had a significant impact on any hiring decision I've made in the past 7 years. Conversations with candidates at job fairs / meetups has.Hiring does not happen on an infinite timescale. A req was opened to address some need the business has. The business would like to address that need on the timescale defined in the needs assessment. Maybe that's ""right now, ASAP"", maybe it's ""sometime before Q4"". The manager ultimately responsible for hiring the person described in the needs assessment does not have infinite time. That manager has other responsibilities that take them away from spending 8 hours per day on hiring. Also, [reqs vanish randomly, often without notice, without reason, and at the least convenient time.](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/wanted/) Even if I as the hiring manager had infinite time to hire this very special req, my budget owner/stakeholders very likely do not have infinite time to wait on the problem being solved.Most of the time, we try very ***very*** hard to hire an existing intern.

nulqrcx,"> In an ideal scenario, an applicant who is enthusiastic, writes a cover letter etc. should get an interview, Bullshit. In what world, and from which perspective, is that even remotely close to ideal?Skills and execution. It doesn't fucking matter if you like doing it or not, so long as you actually do it, and do and do it well.I'll happily admit there is some correlation between the quality of your output and how much joy your work brings you, but it's not 1:1.>but I heard already from some managers that they completely don't look at cover letters due to lack of time, CV is more optimized. Another person instead recommended me to write a cover letter, as it is a way to stand out, especially for relatively junior roles with many applicants.If you're submitting an application, you are selling yourself. No salesperson in the history of ever has tried to get their counterpart to just read the product description. They want face time, to tell the story of their product, to make an emotional appeal.Do you think they send out empty e-mails, with just the technical specs attached and the words ""for your kind consideration""? Or do you think they will use every sentence, every square inch of screen real-estate that they can get to make the other side interested in a conversation?Why on earth would anyone believe that the proven process would work differently when the opportunity you want them to grasp is yourself?For what it's worth, I currently going through my first hiring process on the employer side - I am sitting past an HR filter, so I don't even know if there were any cover letters; I wasn't giving any. But I can tell you this: The majority (of a very, very small pool) of CVs I have seen would not get a pass from me; there's too many slightly reddish flags, and as desperate as I am to work with a larger team, I simply don't have the time to allow someone to correct the misconceptions that their CV has created in the first place.But I would have read a cover letter; I would have read a slightly more detailed CV, and some of the things that tripped me up could have potentially been explained away. Who we invite is not entirely my choice, but I do get a say.And your problem is: I don't aim to be fair, I don't give a damn about giving you a chance. I care about filling a vacancy with someone who primarily has the right skills, enough experience and who I can stand having to talk to a few times a week.And if I know one thing it is this: Once we do hire someone, I lose my voice. I can't get them fired if I think they're a dud, or hard to get along with, so - for my own sake - I have to be very careful and weigh working in a team that's too small vs. working with someone I don't want to work with.And then, neither a CV or a cover letter take eons to write, or to customize for a specific position. Make your documents modular; have blocks that you can shift around if needed, and templates that you can remove or include.Believe me, I write cover letters when I apply for jobs. I have zero proof and no data to show that they work - but I really don't see a world where it's not worth the bit of extra effort.",okayifimust,2025-12-18 00:03:40,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1ppbbyg,False,

nulztds,"I am a hiring manager for SWEs across embedded and distributed systems roles in a small company without dedicated recruiters. I get hundreds of applications a day, and only an incredibly small percentage of those candidates are even possibly qualified. For the ones that look possibly like a fit, some things I look at to decide to screen:- Do the high level bits even KIND OF match? E.g. maybe the job description says 6+ YOE but candidate has 4 YOE and has a Senior SWE title already, or it says looking for embedded C but candidate has several years of embedded Rust experience and has C listed at least somewhere.- If they wrote a cover letter, do they actually understand the kind of role they're applying to? If it's generic or looks like AI slop that's an anti-signal.- Does the resume indicate a clear understanding of WHY the info they list is important or worth mentioning? I do not want a laundry list of every task a candidate has ever done, I want the highlights that indicate skillsets and ability.- Have they articulated previously done work that's similar to what we're looking for, or are they just regurgitating a tech stack? For strong candidates I don't care if they have exact tech stack matches, but sometimes more junior or otherwise weaker-signal candidates will get to a screen for having rare tech stack matches.- Do I recognize their university, prior companies, or anything else on their resume (e.g. notable open source contributions, math or programming competitions, publications at relevant venues)?And frankly at the end of the day I am wildly overloaded and am one person making a quick judgement. I also put significantly more weight on candidates that have been referred to me somehow or who have a shared connection.

num081g,"Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one. In the same vein, every company will have a different interview process. And some people are just assholes. The process doesn't need to be fair, it just can't (legally) be discriminating against people. Some companies have recruiters do the initial resume screen. Some companies ask devs or hiring managers to take a look at resumes before deciding to proceed with a candidate (maybe more so for borderline candidates). At my last company, they hired a contract recruiter who knew nothing about the company, and asked him to do all initial screening and the first ""interview,"" even though he knew nothing about the company or the culture. Some people who review resumes try to be thoughtful. And some are just busy with their work, so they do a really sloppy job or are extra harsh on people. I was late to an interview once because I got stuck on an emergency Teams call. The recruiter pretty much treated me like I was garbage, because how dare I not respect their time? I've seen their company have several rounds of layoffs since then. There may be strong disagreements about the interview process a company has decided to implement, but you might be stuck with just following orders. Some companies don't even give any guidance or training, and just assume their devs will know how to interview people. A smarter place would probably have people shadow and have some type of consistency. But plenty of places don't do that. I myself personally like to read over a resume, see if there's actual interesting things done. I try to see if there's relevant experience. Then, if I interview the person, I ask a mix of real technical questions and deep dive into their resume. I try to get an idea if they really did the work. Can they go into detail? Talk about issues, etc. Or are they elusive and shallow? I also like a lot of back and forth, like you might be working together. I don't like trick questions, but if someone is extremely argumentative or opinionated and not willing to budge on subjective topics, I am likely to pass on them. For me, the gold standard question is, ""would I want to work with this person?"" That's part of why you can't put too much weight on interviews. There might be trends and patterns, but there's also a lot of randomness. I interviewed with a CEO and CTO on different days. And they had different visions of the company. I asked my recruiter if I could speak to someone to get clarification on the inconsistencies. I just got ghosted. We give too much authority to interviewers and companies. They are just people, and some of them are actually really bad at their jobs. To your point about cover letters, maybe the contract recruiter we hired liked them. But if I wanted to see the cover letter, I had to dig around a clunky recruiting software UI to look for it. The tool didn't have an easy way to look at feedback from other people. And should we even be looking at feedback from other interviewers? Some places allow an interviewer to indicate areas for future interviewers to ask a candidate. Other companies don't want you to see feedback from other interviewers, so it doesn't bias you. It really is a mess. I do believe there are companies who do make a good interview experience for their candidates. But there are tons of places that are just awful. I worked at a company that froze hiring, and I had to stress to the team we should notify candidates, partially just out of human decency and partially in case the process picked up again. There are times I've gotten an interview put on my calendar, and when I look at the resume, it looks like complete garbage. I meet the person, and they can barely speak. Like, you're honestly wondering if they have some type of medical issue. How did they get past an initial HR screening? Just like how some people want to be more collaborative, others don't really care and are just focused on metrics. ""I need to write more lines of code, because that's how I'm evaluated.

Agile is all about fast feedback and two weeks to a month (or longer) is too long to go without feedback. If you do shorter sprints, you do need to have much shorter ceremonies as well.If you have on-call during your sprint, you should reduce the number of stories you plan to handle that sprint.

In each case, the emblem is mistaken for the discipline it represents.Managers clutching notes and markers are seldom distant from this same pattern of thought.There is little to be done to reverse it. Cultural change is slow, costly, and perilous, and many will resist it with quiet persistence or open force, for the familiar order offers comfort and shelter.For a season, one may even learn to navigate - and perhaps benefit from - such dysfunction.

The spring framework is rich, learning to leverage its robust ecosystem to solve rudimentary problems is a key to success. The second thing that helped me was understanding design patterns. This one is somewhat controversial. Some people think that they only exist to cover up for language flaws and that they lead to overly abstracted code. Those people aren't wrong but don't worry about joining the debate. Whether or not you believe in using them you will see them all over your code base.
